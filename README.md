# Final Project - Intro to Programming 2016-2017

## Setup:

* Accept the invitation for the git repository
* Clone to your computer
* Create 'readme.md'
* Commit and push - this way I can see who's having trouble setting up git
* Activate your 'data' environment using ```source activate data```

## Overview:

Your final project is to visualize data using Python and Bokeh. You may use any data you wish, as long as it is appropriate for school. I will help with sample data.

## Technical Skills Involved

* Accessing an API and/or reading from a published dataset
* Assessing data
* Creating visualizations

## Expectations

* Visualizations are relevant and helpful in understanding data
* Multiple visualizations should be present, unless a particularly challenging and informative individual visualization merits including only one
* Your work should challenge you
* Git is used appropriately

## Deliverables

* Python programs that created your visualizations (ie ```chart1.py```, ```bargraph.py```, or any other appropriately named python files)
* Copies of your data
* The visualizations created by your program
