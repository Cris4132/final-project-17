       "'ï»¿youth\\n\\n_by_ isaac asimov\\n\\n\\n    red and slim found the two strange little animals the morning after\\n    they heard the thunder sounds. they knew that they could never show\\n    their new pets to their parents.\\n\\n\\n[illustration]\\n\\n\\nthere was a spatter of pebbles against the window and the youngster\\nstirred in his sleep. another, and he was awake.\\n\\nhe sat up stiffly in bed. seconds passed while he interpreted his\\nstrange surroundings. he wasn\\'t in his own home, of course. this was out\\nin the country. it was colder than it should be and there was green at\\nthe window.\\n\\n\"slim!\"\\n\\nthe call was a hoarse, urgent whisper, and the youngster bounded to the\\nopen window.\\n\\nslim wasn\\'t his real name, but the new friend he had met the day before\\nhad needed only one look at his slight figure to say, \"you\\'re slim.\" he\\nadded, \"i\\'m red.\"\\n\\nred wasn\\'t his real name, either, but its appropriateness was obvious.\\nthey were friends instantly with the quick unquestioning friendship of\\nyoung ones not yet quite in adolescence, before even the first stains of\\nadulthood began to make their appearance.\\n\\nslim cried, \"hi, red!\" and waved cheerfully, still blinking the sleep\\nout of himself.\\n\\nred kept to his croaking whisper, \"quiet! you want to wake somebody?\"\\n\\nslim noticed all at once that the sun scarcely topped the low hills in\\nthe east, that the shadows were long and soft, and that the grass was\\nwet.\\n\\nslim said, more softly, \"what\\'s the matter?\"\\n\\nred only waved for him to come out.\\n\\nslim dressed quickly, gladly confining his morning wash to the momentary\\nsprinkle of a little lukewarm water. he let the air dry the exposed\\nportions of his body as he ran out, while bare skin grew wet against the\\ndewy grass.\\n\\nred said, \"you\\'ve got to be quiet. if mom wakes up or dad or your dad or\\neven any of the hands then it\\'ll be \\'come on in or you\\'ll catch your\\ndeath of cold.\\'\"\\n\\nhe mimicked voice and tone faithfully, so that slim laughed and thought\\nthat there had never been so funny a fellow as red.\\n\\nslim said, eagerly, \"do you come out here every day like this, red? real\\nearly? it\\'s like the whole world is just yours, isn\\'t it, red? no one\\nelse around and all like that.\" he felt proud at being allowed entrance\\ninto this private world.\\n\\nred stared at him sidelong. he said carelessly, \"i\\'ve been up for hours.\\ndidn\\'t you hear it last night?\"\\n\\n\"hear what?\"\\n\\n\"thunder.\"\\n\\n\"was there a thunderstorm?\" slim never slept through a thunderstorm.\\n\\n\"i guess not. but there was thunder. i heard it, and then i went to the\\nwindow and it wasn\\'t raining. it was all stars and the sky was just\\ngetting sort of almost gray. you know what i mean?\"\\n\\nslim had never seen it so, but he nodded.\\n\\n\"so i just thought i\\'d go out,\" said red.\\n\\nthey walked along the grassy side of the concrete road that split the\\npanorama right down the middle all the way down to where it vanished\\namong the hills. it was so old that red\\'s father couldn\\'t tell red when\\nit had been built. it didn\\'t have a crack or a rough spot in it.\\n\\nred said, \"can you keep a secret?\"\\n\\n\"sure, red. what kind of a secret?\"\\n\\n\"just a secret. maybe i\\'ll tell you and maybe i won\\'t. i don\\'t know\\nyet.\" red broke a long, supple stem from a fern they passed,\\nmethodically stripped it of its leaflets and swung what was left\\nwhip-fashion. for a moment, he was on a wild charger, which reared and\\nchamped under his iron control. then he got tired, tossed the whip aside\\nand stowed the charger away in a corner of his imagination for future\\nuse.\\n\\nhe said, \"there\\'ll be a circus around.\"\\n\\nslim said, \"that\\'s no secret. i knew that. my dad told me even before we\\ncame here--\"\\n\\n\"that\\'s not the secret. fine secret! ever see a circus?\"\\n\\n\"oh, sure. you bet.\"\\n\\n\"like it?\"\\n\\n\"say, there isn\\'t anything i like better.\"\\n\\nred was watching out of the corner of his eyes again. \"ever think you\\nwould like to be with a circus? i mean, for good?\"\\n\\nslim considered, \"i guess not. i think i\\'ll be an astronomer like my\\ndad. i think he wants me to be.\"\\n\\n\"huh! astronomer!\" said red.\\n\\nslim felt the doors of the new, private world closing on him and\\nastronomy became a thing of dead stars and black, empty space.\\n\\nhe said, placatingly, \"a circus _would_ be more fun.\"\\n\\n\"you\\'re just saying that.\"\\n\\n\"no, i\\'m not. i mean it.\"\\n\\nred grew argumentative. \"suppose you had a chance to join the circus\\nright now. what would you do?\"\\n\\n\"i--i--\"\\n\\n\"see!\" red affected scornful laughter.\\n\\nslim was stung. \"i\\'d join up.\"\\n\\n\"go on.\"\\n\\n\"try me.\"\\n\\nred whirled at him, strange and intense. \"you meant that? you want to go\\nin with me?\"\\n\\n[illustration]\\n\\n\"what do you mean?\" slim stepped back a bit, surprised by the unexpected\\nchallenge.\\n\\n\"i got something that can get us into the circus. maybe someday we can\\neven have a circus of our own. we could be the biggest circus-fellows in\\nthe world. that\\'s if you want to go in with me. otherwise--well, i guess\\ni can do it on my own. i just thought: let\\'s give good old slim a\\nchance.\"\\n\\nthe world was strange and glamorous, and slim said, \"sure thing, red.\\ni\\'m in! what is it, huh, red? tell me what it is.\"\\n\\n\"figure it out. what\\'s the most important thing in circuses?\"\\n\\nslim thought desperately. he wanted to give the right answer. finally,\\nhe said, \"acrobats?\"\\n\\n\"holy smokes! i wouldn\\'t go five steps to look at acrobats.\"\\n\\n\"i don\\'t know then.\"\\n\\n\"animals, that\\'s what! what\\'s the best side-show? where are the biggest\\ncrowds? even in the main rings the best acts are animal acts.\" there was\\nno doubt in red\\'s voice.\\n\\n\"do you think so?\"\\n\\n\"everyone thinks so. you ask anyone. anyway, i found animals this\\nmorning. two of them.\"\\n\\n\"and you\\'ve got them?\"\\n\\n\"sure. that\\'s the secret. are you telling?\"\\n\\n\"of course not.\"\\n\\n\"okay. i\\'ve got them in the barn. do you want to see them?\"\\n\\nthey were almost at the barn; its huge open door black. too black. they\\nhad been heading there all the time. slim stopped in his tracks.\\n\\nhe tried to make his words casual. \"are they big?\"\\n\\n\"would i fool with them if they were big? they can\\'t hurt you. they\\'re\\nonly about so long. i\\'ve got them in a cage.\"\\n\\nthey were in the barn now and slim saw the large cage suspended from a\\nhook in the roof. it was covered with stiff canvas.\\n\\nred said, \"we used to have some bird there or something. anyway, they\\ncan\\'t get away from there. come on, let\\'s go up to the loft.\"\\n\\nthey clambered up the wooden stairs and red hooked the cage toward them.\\n\\nslim pointed and said, \"there\\'s sort of a hole in the canvas.\"\\n\\nred frowned. \"how\\'d that get there?\" he lifted the canvas, looked in,\\nand said, with relief, \"they\\'re still there.\"\\n\\n\"the canvas appeared to be burned,\" worried slim.\\n\\n\"you want to look, or don\\'t you?\"\\n\\nslim nodded slowly. he wasn\\'t sure he wanted to, after all. they might\\nbe--\\n\\nbut the canvas had been jerked off and there they were. two of them, the\\nway red said. they were small, and sort of disgusting-looking. the\\nanimals moved quickly as the canvas lifted and were on the side toward\\nthe youngsters. red poked a cautious finger at them.\\n\\n\"watch out,\" said slim, in agony.\\n\\n\"they don\\'t hurt you,\" said red. \"ever see anything like them?\"\\n\\n\"no.\"\\n\\n\"can\\'t you see how a circus would jump at a chance to have these?\"\\n\\n\"maybe they\\'re too small for a circus.\"\\n\\nred looked annoyed. he let go the cage which swung back and forth\\npendulum-fashion. \"you\\'re just trying to back out, aren\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"no, i\\'m not. it\\'s just--\"\\n\\n\"they\\'re not too small, don\\'t worry. right now, i\\'ve only got one\\nworry.\"\\n\\n\"what\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\"well, i\\'ve got to keep them till the circus comes, don\\'t i? i\\'ve got\\nto figure out what to feed them meanwhile.\"\\n\\nthe cage swung and the little trapped creatures clung to its bars,\\ngesturing at the youngsters with queer, quick motions--almost as though\\nthey were intelligent.\\n\\n\\nii\\n\\nthe astronomer entered the dining room with decorum. he felt very much\\nthe guest.\\n\\nhe said, \"where are the youngsters? my son isn\\'t in his room.\"\\n\\nthe industrialist smiled. \"they\\'ve been out for hours. however,\\nbreakfast was forced into them among the women some time ago, so there\\nis nothing to worry about. youth, doctor, youth!\"\\n\\n\"youth!\" the word seemed to depress the astronomer.\\n\\nthey ate breakfast in silence. the industrialist said once, \"you really\\nthink they\\'ll come. the day looks so--_normal_.\"\\n\\nthe astronomer said, \"they\\'ll come.\"\\n\\nthat was all.\\n\\nafterward the industrialist said, \"you\\'ll pardon me. i can\\'t conceive\\nyour playing so elaborate a hoax. you really spoke to them?\"\\n\\n\"as i speak to you. at least, in a sense. they can project thoughts.\"\\n\\n\"i gathered that must be so from your letter. how, i wonder.\"\\n\\n\"i could not say. i asked them and, of course, they were vague. or\\nperhaps it was just that i could not understand. it involves a projector\\nfor the focussing of thought and, even more than that, conscious\\nattention on the part of both projector and receptor. it was quite a\\nwhile before i realized they were trying to think at me. such\\nthought-projectors may be part of the science they will give us.\"\\n\\n\"perhaps,\" said the industrialist. \"yet think of the changes it would\\nbring to society. a thought-projector!\"\\n\\n\"why not? change would be good for us.\"\\n\\n\"i don\\'t think so.\"\\n\\n\"it is only in old age that change is unwelcome,\" said the astronomer,\\n\"and races can be old as well as individuals.\"\\n\\nthe industrialist pointed out the window. \"you see that road. it was\\nbuilt beforethewars. i don\\'t know exactly when. it is as good now as the\\nday it was built. we couldn\\'t possibly duplicate it now. the race was\\nyoung when that was built, eh?\"\\n\\n\"then? yes! at least they weren\\'t afraid of new things.\"\\n\\n\"no. i wish they had been. where is the society of beforethewars?\\ndestroyed, doctor! what good were youth and new things? we are better\\noff now. the world is peaceful and jogs along. the race goes nowhere but\\nafter all, there is nowhere to go. _they_ proved that. the men who built\\nthe road. i will speak with your visitors as i agreed, if they come. but\\ni think i will only ask them to go.\"\\n\\n\"the race is not going nowhere,\" said the astronomer, earnestly. \"it is\\ngoing toward final destruction. my university has a smaller student body\\neach year. fewer books are written. less work is done. an old man sleeps\\nin the sun and his days are peaceful and unchanging, but each day finds\\nhim nearer death all the same.\"\\n\\n\"well, well,\" said the industrialist.\\n\\n\"no, don\\'t dismiss it. listen. before i wrote you, i investigated your\\nposition in the planetary economy.\"\\n\\n\"and you found me solvent?\" interrupted the industrialist, smiling.\\n\\n\"why, yes. oh, i see, you are joking. and yet--perhaps the joke is not\\nfar off. you are less solvent than your father and he was less solvent\\nthan his father. perhaps your son will no longer be solvent. it becomes\\ntoo troublesome for the planet to support even the industries that still\\nexist, though they are toothpicks to the oak trees of beforethewars. we\\nwill be back to village economy and then to what? the caves?\"\\n\\n\"and the infusion of fresh technological knowledge will be the changing\\nof all that?\"\\n\\n\"not just the new knowledge. rather the whole effect of change, of a\\nbroadening of horizons. look, sir, i chose you to approach in this\\nmatter not only because you were rich and influential with government\\nofficials, but because you had an unusual reputation, for these days, of\\ndaring to break with tradition. our people will resist change and you\\nwould know how to handle them, how to see to it that--that--\"\\n\\n\"that the youth of the race is revived?\"\\n\\n\"yes.\"\\n\\n\"with its atomic bombs?\"\\n\\n\"the atomic bombs,\" returned the astronomer, \"need not be the end of\\ncivilization. these visitors of mine had their atomic bomb, or whatever\\ntheir equivalent was on their own worlds, and survived it, because they\\ndidn\\'t give up. don\\'t you see? it wasn\\'t the bomb that defeated us, but\\nour own shell shock. this may be the last chance to reverse the\\nprocess.\"\\n\\n[illustration]\\n\\n\"tell me,\" said the industrialist, \"what do these friends from space\\nwant in return?\"\\n\\nthe astronomer hesitated. he said, \"i will be truthful with you. they\\ncome from a denser planet. ours is richer in the lighter atoms.\"\\n\\n\"they want magnesium? aluminum?\"\\n\\n\"no, sir. carbon and hydrogen. they want coal and oil.\"\\n\\n\"really?\"\\n\\nthe astronomer said, quickly, \"you are going to ask why creatures who\\nhave mastered space travel, and therefore atomic power, would want coal\\nand oil. i can\\'t answer that.\"\\n\\nthe industrialist smiled. \"but i can. this is the best evidence yet of\\nthe truth of your story. superficially, atomic power would seem to\\npreclude the use of coal and oil. however, quite apart from the energy\\ngained by their combustion they remain, and always will remain, the\\nbasic raw material for all organic chemistry. plastics, dyes,\\npharmaceuticals, solvents. industry could not exist without them, even\\nin an atomic age. still, if coal and oil are the low price for which\\nthey would sell us the troubles and tortures of racial youth, my answer\\nis that the commodity would be dear if offered gratis.\"\\n\\nthe astronomer sighed and said, \"there are the boys!\"\\n\\nthey were visible through the open window, standing together in the\\ngrassy field and lost in animated conversation. the industrialist\\'s son\\npointed imperiously and the astronomer\\'s son nodded and made off at a\\nrun toward the house.\\n\\nthe industrialist said, \"there is the youth you speak of. our race has\\nas much of it as it ever had.\"\\n\\n\"yes, but we age them quickly and pour them into the mold.\"\\n\\nslim scuttled into the room, the door banging behind him.\\n\\nthe astronomer said, in mild disapproval, \"what\\'s this?\"\\n\\nslim looked up in surprise and came to a halt. \"i beg your pardon. i\\ndidn\\'t know anyone was here. i am sorry to have interrupted.\" his\\nenunciation was almost painfully precise.\\n\\nthe industrialist said, \"it\\'s all right, youngster.\"\\n\\nbut the astronomer said, \"even if you had been entering an empty room,\\nson, there would be no cause for slamming a door.\"\\n\\n\"nonsense,\" insisted the industrialist. \"the youngster has done no harm.\\nyou simply scold him for being young. you, with your views!\"\\n\\nhe said to slim, \"come here, lad.\"\\n\\nslim advanced slowly.\\n\\n\"how do you like the country, eh?\"\\n\\n\"very much, sir, thank you.\"\\n\\n\"my son has been showing you about the place, has he?\"\\n\\n\"yes, sir. red--i mean--\"\\n\\n\"no, no. call him red. i call him that myself. now tell me, what are you\\ntwo up to, eh?\"\\n\\nslim looked away. \"why--just exploring, sir.\"\\n\\nthe industrialist turned to the astronomer. \"there you are, youthful\\ncuriosity and adventure-lust. the race has not yet lost it.\"\\n\\nslim said, \"sir?\"\\n\\n\"yes, lad.\"\\n\\nthe youngster took a long time in getting on with it. he said, \"red sent\\nme in for something good to eat, but i don\\'t exactly know what he meant.\\ni didn\\'t like to say so.\"\\n\\n\"why, just ask cook. she\\'ll have something good for young\\'uns to eat.\"\\n\\n\"oh, no, sir. i mean for animals.\"\\n\\n\"for animals?\"\\n\\n\"yes, sir. what do animals eat?\"\\n\\nthe astronomer said, \"i am afraid my son is city-bred.\"\\n\\n\"well,\" said the industrialist, \"there\\'s no harm in that. what kind of\\nan animal, lad?\"\\n\\n\"a small one, sir.\"\\n\\n\"then try grass or leaves, and if they don\\'t want that, nuts or berries\\nwould probably do the trick.\"\\n\\n\"thank you, sir.\" slim ran out again, closing the door gently behind\\nhim.\\n\\nthe astronomer said, \"do you suppose they\\'ve trapped an animal alive?\"\\nhe was obviously perturbed.\\n\\n\"that\\'s common enough. there\\'s no shooting on my estate and it\\'s tame\\ncountry, full of rodents and small creatures. red is always coming home\\nwith pets of one sort or another. they rarely maintain his interest for\\nlong.\"\\n\\nhe looked at the wall clock. \"your friends should have been here by now,\\nshouldn\\'t they?\"\\n\\n\\niii\\n\\nthe swaying had come to a halt and it was dark. the explorer was not\\ncomfortable in the alien air. it felt as thick as soup and he had to\\nbreathe shallowly. even so--\\n\\nhe reached out in a sudden need for company. the merchant was warm to\\nthe touch. his breathing was rough, he moved in an occasional spasm, and\\nwas obviously asleep. the explorer hesitated and decided not to wake\\nhim. it would serve no real purpose.\\n\\nthere would be no rescue, of course. that was the penalty paid for the\\nhigh profits which unrestrained competition could lead to. the merchant\\nwho opened a new planet could have a ten year monopoly of its trade,\\nwhich he might hug to himself or, more likely, rent out to all comers at\\na stiff price. it followed that planets were searched for in secrecy\\nand, preferably, away from the usual trade routes. in a case such as\\ntheirs, then, there was little or no chance that another ship would come\\nwithin range of their subetherics except for the most improbable of\\ncoincidences. even if they were in their ship, that is, rather than in\\nthis--this--_cage_.\\n\\nthe explorer grasped the thick bars. even if they blasted those away, as\\nthey could, they would be stuck too high in open air for leaping.\\n\\nit was too bad. they had landed twice before in the scout-ship. they had\\nestablished contact with the natives who were grotesquely huge, but mild\\nand unaggressive. it was obvious that they had once owned a flourishing\\ntechnology, but hadn\\'t faced up to the consequences of such a\\ntechnology. it would have been a wonderful market.\\n\\nand it was a tremendous world. the merchant, especially, had been taken\\naback. he had known the figures that expressed the planet\\'s diameter,\\nbut from a distance of two light-seconds, he had stood at the visi-plate\\nand muttered, \"unbelievable!\"\\n\\n\"oh, there are larger worlds,\" the explorer said. it wouldn\\'t do for an\\nexplorer to be too easily impressed.\\n\\n\"inhabited?\"\\n\\n\"well, no.\"\\n\\n\"why, you could drop your planet into that large ocean and drown it.\"\\n\\nthe explorer smiled. it was a gentle dig at his arcturian homeland,\\nwhich was smaller than most planets. he said, \"not quite.\"\\n\\nthe merchant followed along the line of his thoughts. \"and the\\ninhabitants are large in proportion to their world?\" he sounded as\\nthough the news struck him less favorably now.\\n\\n\"nearly ten times our height.\"\\n\\n\"are you sure they are friendly?\"\\n\\n\"that is hard to say. friendship between alien intelligences is an\\nimponderable. they are not dangerous, i think. we\\'ve come across other\\ngroups that could not maintain equilibrium after the atomic war stage\\nand you know the results. introversion. retreat. gradual decadence and\\nincreasing gentleness.\"\\n\\n\"even if they are such monsters?\"\\n\\n\"the principle remains.\"\\n\\nit was about then that the explorer felt the heavy throbbing of the\\nengines.\\n\\nhe frowned and said, \"we are descending a bit too quickly.\"\\n\\nthere had been some speculation on the dangers of landing some hours\\nbefore. the planetary target was a huge one for an oxygen-water world.\\nthough it lacked the size of the uninhabitable hydrogen-ammonia planets\\nand its low density made its surface gravity fairly normal, its\\ngravitational forces fell off but slowly with distance. in short, its\\ngravitational potential was high and the ship\\'s calculator was a\\nrun-of-the-mill model not designed to plot landing trajectories at that\\npotential range. that meant the pilot would have to use manual controls.\\n\\nit would have been wiser to install a more high-powered model, but that\\nwould have meant a trip to some outpost of civilization; lost time;\\nperhaps a lost secret. the merchant demanded an immediate landing.\\n\\nthe merchant felt it necessary to defend his position now. he said\\nangrily to the explorer, \"don\\'t you think the pilot knows his job? he\\nlanded you safely twice before.\"\\n\\nyes, thought the explorer, in a scout-ship, not in this unmaneuverable\\nfreighter. aloud, he said nothing.\\n\\nhe kept his eye on the visi-plate. they were descending too quickly.\\nthere was no room for doubt. much too quickly.\\n\\nthe merchant said, peevishly, \"why do you keep silence?\"\\n\\n\"well, then, if you wish me to speak, i would suggest that you strap on\\nyour floater and help me prepare the ejector.\"\\n\\nthe pilot fought a noble fight. he was no beginner. the atmosphere,\\nabnormally high and thick in the gravitational potential of this world\\nwhipped and burned about the ship, but to the very last it looked as\\nthough he might bring it under control despite that.\\n\\nhe even maintained course, following the extrapolated line to the point\\non the northern continent toward which they were headed. under other\\ncircumstances, with a shade more luck, the story would eventually have\\nbeen told and retold as a heroic and masterly reversal of a lost\\nsituation. but within sight of victory, tired body and tired nerves\\nclamped a control bar with a shade too much pressure. the ship, which\\nhad almost levelled off, dipped down again.\\n\\nthere was no room to retrieve the final error. there was only a mile\\nleft to fall. the pilot remained at his post to the actual landing, his\\nonly thought that of breaking the force of the crash, of maintaining the\\nspaceworthiness of the vessel. he did not survive. with the ship bucking\\nmadly in a soupy atmosphere, few ejectors could be mobilized and only\\none of them in time.\\n\\nwhen afterwards, the explorer lifted out of unconsciousness and rose\\nto his feet, he had the definite feeling that but for himself and\\nthe merchant, there were no survivors. and perhaps that was an\\nover-calculation. his floater had burnt out while still sufficiently\\ndistant from surface to have the fall stun him. the merchant might have\\nhad less luck, even, than that.\\n\\nhe was surrounded by a world of thick, ropy stalks of grass, and in the\\ndistance were trees that reminded him vaguely of similar structures on\\nhis native arcturian world except that their lowest branches were high\\nabove what he would consider normal tree-tops.\\n\\nhe called, his voice sounding basso in the thick air and the merchant\\nanswered. the explorer made his way toward him, thrusting violently at\\nthe coarse stalks that barred his path.\\n\\n\"are you hurt?\" he asked.\\n\\nthe merchant grimaced. \"i\\'ve sprained something. it hurts to walk.\"\\n\\nthe explorer probed gently. \"i don\\'t think anything is broken. you\\'ll\\nhave to walk despite the pain.\"\\n\\n\"can\\'t we rest first?\"\\n\\n\"it\\'s important to try to find the ship. if it is spaceworthy or if it\\ncan be repaired, we may live. otherwise, we won\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"just a few minutes. let me catch my breath.\"\\n\\nthe explorer was glad enough for those few minutes. the merchant\\'s eyes\\nwere already closed. he allowed his to do the same.\\n\\nhe heard the trampling and his eyes snapped open. never sleep on a\\nstrange planet, he told himself futilely.\\n\\nthe merchant was awake too and his steady screaming was a rumble of\\nterror.\\n\\nthe explorer called, \"it\\'s only a native of this planet. it won\\'t harm\\nyou.\"\\n\\nbut even as he spoke, the giant had swooped down and in a moment they\\nwere in its grasp being lifted closer to its monstrous ugliness.\\n\\nthe merchant struggled violently and, of course, quite futilely. \"can\\'t\\nyou talk to it?\" he yelled.\\n\\nthe explorer could only shake his head. \"i can\\'t reach it with the\\nprojector. it won\\'t be listening.\"\\n\\n\"then blast it. blast it down.\"\\n\\n\"we can\\'t do that.\" the phrase \"you fool\" had almost been added. the\\nexplorer struggled to keep his self-control. they were swallowing space\\nas the monster moved purposefully away.\\n\\n\"why not?\" cried the merchant. \"you can reach your blaster. i see it in\\nplain sight. don\\'t be afraid of falling.\"\\n\\n\"it\\'s simpler than that. if this monster is killed, you\\'ll never trade\\nwith this planet. you\\'ll never even leave it. you probably won\\'t live\\nthe day out.\"\\n\\n\"why? why?\"\\n\\n\"because this is one of the young of the species. you should know what\\nhappens when a trader kills a native young, even accidentally. what\\'s\\nmore, if this is the target-point, then we are on the estate of a\\npowerful native. this might be one of his brood.\"\\n\\nthat was how they entered their present prison. they had carefully burnt\\naway a portion of the thick, stiff covering and it was obvious that the\\nheight from which they were suspended was a killing one.\\n\\nnow, once again, the prison-cage shuddered and lifted in an upward arc.\\nthe merchant rolled to the lower rim and startled awake. the cover\\nlifted and light flooded in. as was the case the time before, there were\\ntwo specimens of the young. they were not very different in appearance\\nfrom adults of the species, reflected the explorer, though, of course,\\nthey were considerably smaller.\\n\\na handful of reedy green stalks was stuffed between the bars. its odor\\nwas not unpleasant but it carried clods of soil at its ends.\\n\\nthe merchant drew away and said, huskily, \"what are they doing?\"\\n\\nthe explorer said, \"trying to feed us, i should judge. at least this\\nseems to be the native equivalent of grass.\"\\n\\nthe cover was replaced and they were set swinging again, alone with\\ntheir fodder.\\n\\n\\niv\\n\\nslim started at the sound of footsteps and brightened when it turned out\\nto be only red.\\n\\nhe said, \"no one\\'s around. i had my eye peeled, you bet.\"\\n\\nred said, \"ssh. look. you take this stuff and stick it in the cage. i\\'ve\\ngot to scoot back to the house.\"\\n\\n\"what is it?\" slim reached reluctantly.\\n\\n\"ground meat. holy smokes, haven\\'t you ever seen ground meat? that\\'s\\nwhat you should\\'ve got when i sent you to the house instead of coming\\nback with that stupid grass.\"\\n\\nslim was hurt. \"how\\'d i know they don\\'t eat grass. besides, ground meat\\ndoesn\\'t come loose like that. it comes in cellophane and it isn\\'t that\\ncolor.\"\\n\\n\"sure--in the city. out here we grind our own and it\\'s always this color\\ntill it\\'s cooked.\"\\n\\n\"you mean it isn\\'t cooked?\" slim drew away quickly.\\n\\nred looked disgusted. \"do you think animals eat _cooked_ food. come on,\\ntake it. it won\\'t hurt you. i tell you there isn\\'t much time.\"\\n\\n\"why? what\\'s doing back at the house?\"\\n\\n\"i don\\'t know. dad and your father are walking around. i think maybe\\nthey\\'re looking for me. maybe the cook told them i took the meat.\\nanyway, we don\\'t want them coming here after me.\"\\n\\n\"didn\\'t you ask the cook before you took this stuff?\"\\n\\n\"who? that crab? shouldn\\'t wonder if she only let me have a drink of\\nwater because dad makes her. come on. take it.\"\\n\\nslim took the large glob of meat though his skin crawled at the touch.\\nhe turned toward the barn and red sped away in the direction from which\\nhe had come.\\n\\nhe slowed when he approached the two adults, took a few deep breaths to\\nbring himself back to normal, and then carefully and nonchalantly\\nsauntered past. (they were walking in the general direction of the barn,\\nhe noticed, but not dead on.)\\n\\nhe said, \"hi, dad. hello, sir.\"\\n\\nthe industrialist said, \"just a moment, red. i have a question to ask\\nyou?\"\\n\\nred turned a carefully blank face to his father. \"yes, dad?\"\\n\\n\"mother tells me you were out early this morning.\"\\n\\n\"not real early, dad. just a little before breakfast.\"\\n\\n\"she said you told her it was because you had been awakened during the\\nnight and didn\\'t go back to sleep.\"\\n\\nred waited before answering. should he have told mom that?\\n\\nthen he said, \"yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"what was it that awakened you?\"\\n\\nred saw no harm in it. he said, \"i don\\'t know, dad. it sounded like\\nthunder, sort of, and like a collision, sort of.\"\\n\\n\"could you tell where it came from?\"\\n\\n\"it _sounded_ like it was out by the hill.\" that was truthful, and\\nuseful as well, since the direction was almost opposite that in which\\nthe barn lay.\\n\\nthe industrialist looked at his guest. \"i suppose it would do no harm to\\nwalk toward the hill.\"\\n\\nthe astronomer said, \"i am ready.\"\\n\\nred watched them walk away and when he turned he saw slim peering\\ncautiously out from among the briars of a hedge.\\n\\nred waved at him. \"come on.\"\\n\\nslim stepped out and approached. \"did they say anything about the meat?\"\\n\\n\"no. i guess they don\\'t know about that. they went down to the hill.\"\\n\\n\"what for?\"\\n\\n\"search me. they kept asking about the noise i heard. listen, did the\\nanimals eat the meat?\"\\n\\n\"well,\" said slim, cautiously, \"they were sort of _looking_ at it and\\nsmelling it or something.\"\\n\\n\"okay,\" red said, \"i guess they\\'ll eat it. holy smokes, they\\'ve got to\\neat _something_. let\\'s walk along toward the hill and see what dad and\\nyour father are going to do.\"\\n\\n\"what about the animals?\"\\n\\n\"they\\'ll be all right. a fellow can\\'t spend all his time on them. did\\nyou give them water?\"\\n\\n\"sure. they drank that.\"\\n\\n\"see. come on. we\\'ll look at them after lunch. i tell you what. we\\'ll\\nbring them fruit. anything\\'ll eat fruit.\"\\n\\ntogether they trotted up the rise, red, as usual, in the lead.\\n\\n\\nv\\n\\nthe astronomer said, \"you think the noise was their ship landing?\"\\n\\n\"don\\'t you think it could be?\"\\n\\n\"if it were, they may all be dead.\"\\n\\n\"perhaps not.\" the industrialist frowned.\\n\\n\"if they have landed, and are still alive, where are they?\"\\n\\n\"think about that for a while.\" he was still frowning.\\n\\nthe astronomer said, \"i don\\'t understand you.\"\\n\\n\"they may not be friendly.\"\\n\\n\"oh, no. i\\'ve spoken with them. they\\'ve--\"\\n\\n\"you\\'ve spoken with them. call that reconnaissance. what would their\\nnext step be? invasion?\"\\n\\n\"but they only have one ship, sir.\"\\n\\n\"you know that only because they say so. they might have a fleet.\"\\n\\n\"i\\'ve told you about their size. they--\"\\n\\n\"their size would not matter, if they have handweapons that may well be\\nsuperior to our artillery.\"\\n\\n\"that is not what i meant.\"\\n\\n\"i had this partly in mind from the first.\" the industrialist went on.\\n\"it is for that reason i agreed to see them after i received your\\nletter. not to agree to an unsettling and impossible trade, but to judge\\ntheir real purposes. i did not count on their evading the meeting.\"\\n\\nhe sighed. \"i suppose it isn\\'t our fault. you are right in one thing, at\\nany rate. the world has been at peace too long. we are losing a healthy\\nsense of suspicion.\"\\n\\nthe astronomer\\'s mild voice rose to an unusual pitch and he said, \"i\\n_will_ speak. i tell you that there is no reason to suppose they can\\npossibly be hostile. they are small, yes, but that is only important\\nbecause it is a reflection of the fact that their native worlds are\\nsmall. our world has what is for them a normal gravity, but because of\\nour much higher gravitational potential, our atmosphere is too dense to\\nsupport them comfortably over sustained periods. for a similar reason\\nthe use of the world as a base for interstellar travel, except for trade\\nin certain items, is uneconomical. and there are important differences\\nin chemistry of life due to the basic differences in soils. they\\ncouldn\\'t eat our food or we theirs.\"\\n\\n\"surely all this can be overcome. they can bring their own food, build\\ndomed stations of lowered air pressure, devise specially designed\\nships.\"\\n\\n\"they can. and how glibly you can describe feats that are easy to a race\\nin its youth. it is simply that they don\\'t have to do any of that. there\\nare millions of worlds suitable for them in the galaxy. they don\\'t need\\nthis one which isn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"how do you know? all this is their information again.\"\\n\\n\"this i was able to check independently. i am an astronomer, after all.\"\\n\\n\"that is true. let me hear what you have to say then, while we walk.\"\\n\\n\"then, sir, consider that for a long time our astronomers have believed\\nthat two general classes of planetary bodies existed. first, the planets\\nwhich formed at distances far enough from their stellar nucleus to\\nbecome cool enough to capture hydrogen. these would be large planets\\nrich in hydrogen, ammonia and methane. we have examples of these in the\\ngiant outer planets. the second class would include those planets formed\\nso near the stellar center that the high temperature would make it\\nimpossible to capture much hydrogen. these would be smaller planets,\\ncomparatively poorer in hydrogen and richer in oxygen. we know that type\\nvery well since we live on one. ours is the only solar system we know in\\ndetail, however, and it has been reasonable for us to assume that these\\nwere the _only_ two planetary classes.\"\\n\\n\"i take it then that there is another.\"\\n\\n\"yes. there is a super-dense class, still smaller, poorer in hydrogen,\\nthan the inner planets of the solar system. the ratio of occurrence of\\nhydrogen-ammonia planets and these super-dense water-oxygen worlds of\\ntheirs over the entire galaxy--and remember that they have actually\\nconducted a survey of significant sample volumes of the galaxy which we,\\nwithout interstellar travel, cannot do--is about 3 to 1. this leaves\\nthem seven million super-dense worlds for exploration and colonization.\"\\n\\nthe industrialist looked at the blue sky and the green-covered trees\\namong which they were making their way. he said, \"and worlds like ours?\"\\n\\nthe astronomer said, softly, \"ours is the first solar system they have\\nfound which contains them. apparently the development of our solar\\nsystem was unique and did not follow the ordinary rules.\"\\n\\nthe industrialist considered that. \"what it amounts to is that these\\ncreatures from space are asteroid-dwellers.\"\\n\\n\"no, no. the asteroids are something else again. they occur, i was told,\\nin one out of eight stellar systems, but they\\'re completely different\\nfrom what we\\'ve been discussing.\"\\n\\n\"and how does your being an astronomer change the fact that you are\\nstill only quoting their unsupported statements?\"\\n\\n\"but they did not restrict themselves to bald items of information. they\\npresented me with a theory of stellar evolution which i had to accept\\nand which is more nearly valid than anything our own astronomy has ever\\nbeen able to devise, if we except possible lost theories dating from\\nbeforethewars. mind you, their theory had a rigidly mathematical\\ndevelopment and it predicted just such a galaxy as they describe. so you\\nsee, they have all the worlds they wish. they are not land-hungry.\\ncertainly not for our land.\"\\n\\n\"reason would say so, if what you say is true. but creatures may be\\nintelligent and not reasonable. our forefathers were presumably\\nintelligent, yet they were certainly not reasonable. was it reasonable\\nto destroy almost all their tremendous civilization in atomic warfare\\nover causes our historians can no longer accurately determine?\" the\\nindustrialist brooded over it. \"from the dropping of the first atom bomb\\nover those islands--i forget the ancient name--there was only one end in\\nsight, and in plain sight. yet events were allowed to proceed to that\\nend.\"\\n\\nhe looked up, said briskly, \"well, where are we? i wonder if we are not\\non a fool\\'s errand after all.\"\\n\\nbut the astronomer was a little in advance and his voice came thickly.\\n\"no fool\\'s errand, sir. look there.\"\\n\\n\\nvi\\n\\nred and slim had trailed their elders with the experience of youth,\\naided by the absorption and anxiety of their fathers. their view of the\\nfinal object of the search was somewhat obscured by the underbrush\\nbehind which they remained.\\n\\nred said, \"holy smokes. look at that. it\\'s all shiny silver or\\nsomething.\"\\n\\nbut it was slim who was really excited. he caught at the other. \"i know\\nwhat this is. it\\'s a space-ship. that must be why my father came here.\\nhe\\'s one of the biggest astronomers in the world and your father would\\nhave to call him if a space-ship landed on his estate.\"\\n\\n\"what are you talking about? dad didn\\'t even know that thing was there.\\nhe only came here because i told him i heard the thunder from here.\\nbesides, there isn\\'t any such thing as a space-ship.\"\\n\\n\"sure, there is. look at it. see those round things. they are ports. and\\nyou can see the rocket tubes.\"\\n\\n\"how do you know so much?\"\\n\\nslim was flushed. he said, \"i read about them. my father has books about\\nthem. old books. from beforethewars.\"\\n\\n\"huh. now i know you\\'re making it up. books from beforethewars!\"\\n\\n\"my father _has_ to have them. he teaches at the university. it\\'s his\\njob.\"\\n\\nhis voice had risen and red had to pull at him. \"you want them to hear\\nus?\" he whispered indignantly.\\n\\n\"well, it is, too, a space-ship.\"\\n\\n\"look here, slim, you mean that\\'s a ship from another world.\"\\n\\n\"it\\'s _got_ to be. look at my father going round and round it. he\\nwouldn\\'t be so interested if it was anything else.\"\\n\\n\"other worlds! where are there other worlds?\"\\n\\n\"everywhere. how about the planets? they\\'re worlds just like ours, some\\nof them. and other stars probably have planets. there\\'s probably\\nzillions of planets.\"\\n\\nred felt outweighed and outnumbered. he muttered, \"you\\'re crazy!\"\\n\\n\"all right, then. i\\'ll show you.\"\\n\\n\"hey! where are you going?\"\\n\\n\"down there. i\\'m going to ask my father. i suppose you\\'ll believe it if\\n_he_ tells you. i suppose you\\'ll believe a professor of astronomy knows\\nwhat--\"\\n\\nhe had scrambled upright.\\n\\nred said, \"hey. you don\\'t want them to see us. we\\'re not supposed to be\\nhere. do you want them to start asking questions and find out about our\\nanimals?\"\\n\\n\"i don\\'t care. you said i was crazy.\"\\n\\n\"snitcher! you promised you wouldn\\'t tell.\"\\n\\n\"i\\'m _not_ going to tell. but if they find out themselves, it\\'s your\\nfault, for starting an argument and saying i was crazy.\"\\n\\n\"i take it back, then,\" grumbled red.\\n\\n\"well, all right. you better.\"\\n\\nin a way, slim was disappointed. he wanted to see the space-ship at\\ncloser quarters. still, he could not break his vow of secrecy even in\\nspirit without at least the excuse of personal insult.\\n\\nred said, \"it\\'s awfully small for a space-ship.\"\\n\\n\"sure, because it\\'s probably a scout-ship.\"\\n\\n\"i\\'ll bet dad couldn\\'t even get into the old thing.\"\\n\\nso much slim realized to be true. it was a weak point in his argument\\nand he made no answer. his interest was absorbed by the adults.\\n\\nred rose to his feet; an elaborate attitude of boredom all about him.\\n\"well, i guess we better be going. there\\'s business to do and i can\\'t\\nspend all day here looking at some old space-ship or whatever it is.\\nwe\\'ve got to take care of the animals if we\\'re going to be circus-folks.\\nthat\\'s the first rule with circus-folks. they\\'ve got to take care of the\\nanimals. and,\" he finished virtuously, \"that\\'s what i aim to do,\\nanyway.\"\\n\\nslim said, \"what for, red? they\\'ve got plenty of meat. let\\'s watch.\"\\n\\n\"there\\'s no fun in watching. besides dad and your father are going away\\nand i guess it\\'s about lunch time.\"\\n\\nred became argumentative. \"look, slim, we can\\'t start acting suspicious\\nor they\\'re going to start investigating. holy smokes, don\\'t you ever\\nread any detective stories? when you\\'re trying to work a big deal\\nwithout being caught, it\\'s practically the main thing to keep on acting\\njust like always. then they don\\'t suspect anything. that\\'s the first\\nlaw--\"\\n\\n\"oh, all right.\"\\n\\nslim rose resentfully. at the moment, the circus appeared to him a\\nrather tawdry and shoddy substitute for the glories of astronomy, and he\\nwondered how he had come to fall in with red\\'s silly scheme.\\n\\ndown the slope they went, slim, as usual, in the rear.\\n\\n\\nvii\\n\\nthe industrialist said, \"it\\'s the workmanship that gets me. i never saw\\nsuch construction.\"\\n\\n\"what good is it now?\" said the astronomer, bitterly. \"there\\'s nothing\\nleft. there\\'ll be no second landing. this ship detected life on our\\nplanet through accident. other exploring parties would come no closer\\nthan necessary to establish the fact that there were no super-dense\\nworlds existing in our solar system.\"\\n\\n\"well, there\\'s no quarreling with a crash landing.\"\\n\\n\"the ship hardly seems damaged. if only some had survived, the ship\\nmight have been repaired.\"\\n\\n\"if they had survived, there would be no trade in any case. they\\'re too\\ndifferent. too disturbing. in any case--it\\'s over.\"\\n\\nthey entered the house and the industrialist greeted his wife calmly.\\n\"lunch about ready, dear.\"\\n\\n\"i\\'m afraid not. you see--\" she looked hesitantly at the astronomer.\\n\\n\"is anything wrong?\" asked the industrialist. \"why not tell me? i\\'m sure\\nour guest won\\'t mind a little family discussion.\"\\n\\n\"pray don\\'t pay any attention whatever to me,\" muttered the astronomer.\\nhe moved miserably to the other end of the living room.\\n\\nthe woman said, in low, hurried tones, \"really, dear, cook\\'s that upset.\\ni\\'ve been soothing her for hours and honestly, i don\\'t know why red\\nshould have done it.\"\\n\\n\"done what?\" the industrialist was more amused than otherwise. it had\\ntaken the united efforts of himself and his son months to argue his wife\\ninto using the name \"red\" rather than the perfectly ridiculous (viewed\\nyoungster fashion) name which was his real one.\\n\\nshe said, \"he\\'s taken most of the chopped meat.\"\\n\\n\"he\\'s eaten it?\"\\n\\n\"well, i hope not. it was raw.\"\\n\\n\"then what would he want it for?\"\\n\\n\"i haven\\'t the slightest idea. i haven\\'t seen him since breakfast.\\nmeanwhile cook\\'s just furious. she caught him vanishing out the kitchen\\ndoor and there was the bowl of chopped meat just about empty and she was\\ngoing to use it for lunch. well, you know cook. she had to change the\\nlunch menu and that means she won\\'t be worth living with for a week.\\nyou\\'ll just have to speak to red, dear, and make him promise not to do\\nthings in the kitchen any more. and it wouldn\\'t hurt to have him\\napologize to cook.\"\\n\\n\"oh, come. she works for us. if we don\\'t complain about a change in\\nlunch menu, why should she?\"\\n\\n\"because she\\'s the one who has double-work made for her, and she\\'s\\ntalking about quitting. good cooks aren\\'t easy to get. do you remember\\nthe one before her?\"\\n\\nit was a strong argument.\\n\\nthe industrialist looked about vaguely. he said, \"i suppose you\\'re\\nright. he isn\\'t here, i suppose. when he comes in, i\\'ll talk to him.\"\\n\\n\"you\\'d better start. here he comes.\"\\n\\nred walked into the house and said cheerfully, \"time for lunch, i\\nguess.\" he looked from one parent to the other in quick speculation at\\ntheir fixed stares and said, \"got to clean up first, though,\" and made\\nfor the other door.\\n\\nthe industrialist said, \"one moment, son.\"\\n\\n\"sir?\"\\n\\n\"where\\'s your little friend?\"\\n\\nred said, carelessly, \"he\\'s around somewhere. we were just sort of\\nwalking and i looked around and he wasn\\'t there.\" this was perfectly\\ntrue, and red felt on safe ground. \"i told him it was lunch time. i\\nsaid, \\'i suppose it\\'s about lunch time.\\' i said, \\'we got to be getting\\nback to the house.\\' and he said, \\'yes.\\' and i just went on and then when\\ni was about at the creek i looked around and--\"\\n\\nthe astronomer interrupted the voluble story, looking up from a\\nmagazine he had been sightlessly rummaging through. \"i wouldn\\'t worry\\nabout my youngster. he is quite self-reliant. don\\'t wait lunch for him.\"\\n\\n\"lunch isn\\'t ready in any case, doctor.\" the industrialist turned once\\nmore to his son. \"and talking about that, son, the reason for it is that\\nsomething happened to the ingredients. do you have anything to say?\"\\n\\n\"sir?\"\\n\\n\"i hate to feel that i have to explain myself more fully. why did you\\ntake the chopped meat?\"\\n\\n\"the chopped meat?\"\\n\\n\"the chopped meat.\" he waited patiently.\\n\\nred said, \"well, i was sort of--\"\\n\\n\"hungry?\" prompted his father. \"for raw meat?\"\\n\\n\"no, sir. i just sort of needed it.\"\\n\\n\"for what exactly?\"\\n\\nred looked miserable and remained silent.\\n\\nthe astronomer broke in again. \"if you don\\'t mind my putting in a few\\nwords--you\\'ll remember that just after breakfast my son came in to ask\\nwhat animals ate.\"\\n\\n\"oh, you\\'re right. how stupid of me to forget. look here, red, did you\\ntake it for an animal pet you\\'ve got?\"\\n\\nred recovered indignant breath. he said, \"you mean slim came in here and\\nsaid i had an animal? he came in here and said that? he said i had an\\nanimal?\"\\n\\n\"no, he didn\\'t. he simply asked what animals ate. that\\'s all. now if he\\npromised he wouldn\\'t tell on you, he didn\\'t. it\\'s your own foolishness\\nin trying to take something without permission that gave you away. that\\nhappened to be stealing. now have you an animal? i ask you a direct\\nquestion.\"\\n\\n\"yes, sir.\" it was a whisper so low as hardly to be heard.\\n\\n\"all right, you\\'ll have to get rid of it. do you understand?\"\\n\\nred\\'s mother intervened. \"do you mean to say you\\'re keeping a\\nmeat-eating animal, red? it might bite you and give you blood-poison.\"\\n\\n\"they\\'re only small ones,\" quavered red. \"they hardly budge if you touch\\nthem.\"\\n\\n\"they? how many do you have?\"\\n\\n\"two.\"\\n\\n\"where are they?\"\\n\\nthe industrialist touched her arm. \"don\\'t chivvy the child any further,\"\\nhe said, in a low voice. \"if he says he\\'ll get rid of them, he will,\\nand that\\'s punishment enough.\"\\n\\nhe dismissed the matter from his mind.\\n\\n\\nviii\\n\\nlunch was half over when slim dashed into the dining room. for a moment,\\nhe stood abashed, and then he said in what was almost hysteria, \"i\\'ve\\ngot to speak to red. i\\'ve got to say something.\"\\n\\nred looked up in fright, but the astronomer said, \"i don\\'t think, son,\\nyou\\'re being very polite. you\\'ve kept lunch waiting.\"\\n\\n\"i\\'m sorry, father.\"\\n\\n\"oh, don\\'t rate the lad,\" said the industrialist\\'s wife. \"he can speak\\nto red if he wants to, and there was no damage done to the lunch.\"\\n\\n\"i\\'ve got to speak to red alone,\" slim insisted.\\n\\n\"now that\\'s enough,\" said the astronomer with a kind of gentleness that\\nwas obviously manufactured for the benefit of strangers and which had\\nbeneath it an easily-recognized edge. \"take your seat.\"\\n\\nslim did so, but he ate only when someone looked directly upon him. even\\nthen he was not very successful.\\n\\nred caught his eyes. he made soundless words, \"did the animals get\\nloose?\"\\n\\nslim shook his head slightly. he whispered, \"no, it\\'s--\"\\n\\nthe astronomer looked at him hard and slim faltered to a stop.\\n\\nwith lunch over, red slipped out of the room, with a microscopic motion\\nat slim to follow.\\n\\nthey walked in silence to the creek.\\n\\nthen red turned fiercely upon his companion. \"look here, what\\'s the idea\\nof telling my dad we were feeding animals?\"\\n\\nslim said, \"i didn\\'t. i asked what you feed animals. that\\'s not the same\\nas saying we were doing it. besides, it\\'s something else, red.\"\\n\\nbut red had not used up his grievances. \"and where did you go anyway? i\\nthought you were coming to the house. they acted like it was my fault\\nyou weren\\'t there.\"\\n\\n\"but i\\'m trying to tell you about that, if you\\'d only shut _up_ a second\\nand let me talk. you don\\'t give a fellow a chance.\"\\n\\n\"well, go on and tell me if you\\'ve got so much to say.\"\\n\\n\"i\\'m _trying_ to. i went back to the space-ship. the folks weren\\'t there\\nanymore and i wanted to see what it was like.\"\\n\\n\"it isn\\'t a space-ship,\" said red, sullenly. he had nothing to lose.\\n\\n\"it is, too. i looked inside. you could look through the ports and i\\nlooked inside and they were _dead_.\" he looked sick. \"they were dead.\"\\n\\n\"_who_ were dead.\"\\n\\nslim screeched, \"animals! like _our_ animals! only they _aren\\'t_\\nanimals. they\\'re people-things from other planets.\"\\n\\nfor a moment red might have been turned to stone. it didn\\'t occur to him\\nto disbelieve slim at this point. slim looked too genuinely the bearer\\nof just such tidings. he said, finally, \"oh, my.\"\\n\\n\"well, what are we going to do? golly, will we get a whopping if they\\nfind out?\" he was shivering.\\n\\n\"we better turn them loose,\" said red.\\n\\n\"they\\'ll tell on us.\"\\n\\n\"they can\\'t talk our language. not if they\\'re from another planet.\"\\n\\n\"yes, they can. because i remember my father talking about some stuff\\nlike that to my mother when he didn\\'t know i was in the room. he was\\ntalking about visitors who could talk with the mind. telepathery or\\nsomething. i thought he was making it up.\"\\n\\n\"well, holy smokes. i mean--holy smokes.\" red looked up. \"i tell you. my\\ndad said to get rid of them. let\\'s sort of bury them somewhere or throw\\nthem in the creek.\"\\n\\n\"he _told_ you to do that.\"\\n\\n\"he made me say i had animals and then he said, \\'get rid of them.\\' i got\\nto do what he says. holy smokes, he\\'s my dad.\"\\n\\nsome of the panic left slim\\'s heart. it was a thoroughly legalistic way\\nout. \"well, let\\'s do it right now, then, before they find out. oh,\\ngolly, if they find out, will we be in trouble!\"\\n\\nthey broke into a run toward the barn, unspeakable visions in their\\nminds.\\n\\n\\nix\\n\\nit was different, looking at them as though they were \"people.\" as\\nanimals, they had been interesting; as \"people,\" horrible. their eyes,\\nwhich were neutral little objects before, now seemed to watch them with\\nactive malevolence.\\n\\n\"they\\'re making noises,\" said slim, in a whisper which was barely\\naudible.\\n\\n\"i guess they\\'re talking or something,\" said red. funny that those\\nnoises which they had heard before had not had significance earlier. he\\nwas making no move toward them. neither was slim.\\n\\nthe canvas was off but they were just watching. the ground meat, slim\\nnoticed, hadn\\'t been touched.\\n\\nslim said, \"aren\\'t you going to do something?\"\\n\\n\"aren\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"you found them.\"\\n\\n\"it\\'s your turn, now.\"\\n\\n\"no, it isn\\'t. you found them. it\\'s your fault, the whole thing. i was\\nwatching.\"\\n\\n\"you joined in, slim. you know you did.\"\\n\\n\"i don\\'t care. you found them and that\\'s what i\\'ll say when they come\\nhere looking for us.\"\\n\\nred said, \"all right for you.\" but the thought of the consequences\\ninspired him anyway, and he reached for the cage door.\\n\\nslim said, \"wait!\"\\n\\nred was glad to. he said, \"now what\\'s biting you?\"\\n\\n\"one of them\\'s got something on him that looks like it might be iron or\\nsomething.\"\\n\\n\"where?\"\\n\\n\"right there. i saw it before but i thought it was just part of him. but\\nif he\\'s \\'people,\\' maybe it\\'s a disintegrator gun.\"\\n\\n\"what\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\"i read about it in the books from beforethewars. mostly people with\\nspace-ships have disintegrator guns. they point them at you and you get\\ndisintegratored.\"\\n\\n\"they didn\\'t point it at us till now,\" pointed out red with his heart\\nnot quite in it.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t care. i\\'m not hanging around here and getting disintegratored.\\ni\\'m getting my father.\"\\n\\n\"cowardy-cat. yellow cowardy-cat.\"\\n\\n\"i don\\'t care. you can call all the names you want, but if you bother\\nthem now you\\'ll get disintegratored. you wait and see, and it\\'ll be all\\nyour fault.\"\\n\\nhe made for the narrow spiral stairs that led to the main floor of the\\nbarn, stopped at its head, then backed away.\\n\\nred\\'s mother was moving up, panting a little with the exertion and\\nsmiling a tight smile for the benefit of slim in his capacity as guest.\\n\\n\"red! you, red! are you up there? now don\\'t try to hide. i know this is\\nwhere you\\'re keeping them. cook saw where you ran with the meat.\"\\n\\nred quavered, \"hello, ma!\"\\n\\n\"now show me those nasty animals? i\\'m going to see to it that you get\\nrid of them right away.\"\\n\\nit was over! and despite the imminent corporal punishment, red felt\\nsomething like a load fall from him. at least the decision was out of\\nhis hands.\\n\\n\"right there, ma. i didn\\'t do anything to them, ma. i didn\\'t know. they\\njust looked like little animals and i thought you\\'d let me keep them,\\nma. i wouldn\\'t have taken the meat only they wouldn\\'t eat grass or\\nleaves and we couldn\\'t find good nuts or berries and cook never lets me\\nhave anything or i would have asked her and i didn\\'t know it was for\\nlunch and--\"\\n\\nhe was speaking on the sheer momentum of terror and did not realize that\\nhis mother did not hear him but, with eyes frozen and popping at the\\ncage, was screaming in thin, piercing tones.\\n\\n\\nx\\n\\nthe astronomer was saying, \"a quiet burial is all we can do. there is no\\npoint in any publicity now,\" when they heard the screams.\\n\\nshe had not entirely recovered by the time she reached them, running and\\nrunning. it was minutes before her husband could extract sense from her.\\n\\nshe was saying, finally, \"i tell you they\\'re in the barn. i don\\'t know\\nwhat they are. no, no--\"\\n\\nshe barred the industrialist\\'s quick movement in that direction. she\\nsaid, \"don\\'t _you_ go. send one of the hands with a shotgun. i tell you\\ni never saw anything like it. little horrible beasts with--with--i can\\'t\\ndescribe it. to think that red was touching them and trying to feed\\nthem. he was _holding_ them, and feeding them meat.\"\\n\\nred began, \"i only--\"\\n\\nand slim said, \"it was not--\"\\n\\nthe industrialist said, quickly, \"now you boys have done enough harm\\ntoday. march! into the house! and not a word; not one word! i\\'m not\\ninterested in anything you have to say. after this is all over, i\\'ll\\nhear you out and as for you, red, i\\'ll see that you\\'re properly\\npunished.\"\\n\\nhe turned to his wife. \"now whatever the animals are, we\\'ll have them\\nkilled.\" he added quietly once the youngsters were out of hearing,\\n\"come, come. the children aren\\'t hurt and, after all, they haven\\'t done\\nanything really terrible. they\\'ve just found a new pet.\"\\n\\nthe astronomer spoke with difficulty. \"pardon me, ma\\'am, but can you\\ndescribe these animals?\"\\n\\nshe shook her head. she was quite beyond words.\\n\\n\"can you just tell me if they--\"\\n\\n\"i\\'m sorry,\" said the industrialist, apologetically, \"but i think i had\\nbetter take care of her. will you excuse me?\"\\n\\n\"a moment. please. one moment. she said she had never seen such animals\\nbefore. surely it is not usual to find animals that are completely\\nunique on an estate such as this.\"\\n\\n\"i\\'m sorry. let\\'s not discuss that now.\"\\n\\n\"except that unique animals might have landed during the night.\"\\n\\nthe industrialist stepped away from his wife. \"what are you implying?\"\\n\\n\"i think we had better go to the barn, sir!\"\\n\\nthe industrialist stared a moment, turned and suddenly and quite\\nuncharacteristically began running. the astronomer followed and the\\nwoman\\'s wail rose unheeded behind them.\\n\\n\\nxi\\n\\nthe industrialist stared, looked at the astronomer, turned to stare\\nagain.\\n\\n\"those?\"\\n\\n\"those,\" said the astronomer. \"i have no doubt we appear strange and\\nrepulsive to them.\"\\n\\n\"what do they say?\"\\n\\n\"why, that they are uncomfortable and tired and even a little sick, but\\nthat they are not seriously damaged, and that the youngsters treated\\nthem well.\"\\n\\n\"treated them well! scooping them up, keeping them in a cage, giving\\nthem grass and raw meat to eat? tell me how to speak to them.\"\\n\\n\"it may take a little time. think _at_ them. try to listen. it will come\\nto you, but perhaps not right away.\"\\n\\nthe industrialist tried. he grimaced with the effort of it, thinking\\nover and over again, \"the youngsters were ignorant of your identity.\"\\n\\nand the thought was suddenly in his mind: \"we were quite aware of it and\\nbecause we knew they meant well by us according to their own view of the\\nmatter, we did not attempt to attack them.\"\\n\\n\"attack them?\" thought the industrialist, and said it aloud in his\\nconcentration.\\n\\n\"why, yes,\" came the answering thought. \"we are armed.\"\\n\\none of the revolting little creatures in the cage lifted a metal object\\nand there was a sudden hole in the top of the cage and another in the\\nroof of the barn, each hole rimmed with charred wood.\\n\\n\"we hope,\" the creatures thought, \"it will not be too difficult to make\\nrepairs.\"\\n\\nthe industrialist found it impossible to organize himself to the point\\nof directed thought. he turned to the astronomer. \"and with that weapon\\nin their possession they let themselves be handled and caged? i don\\'t\\nunderstand it.\"\\n\\nbut the calm thought came, \"we would not harm the young of an\\nintelligent species.\"\\n\\n\\nxii\\n\\nit was twilight. the industrialist had entirely missed the evening meal\\nand remained unaware of the fact.\\n\\nhe said, \"do you really think the ship will fly?\"\\n\\n\"if they say so,\" said the astronomer, \"i\\'m sure it will. they\\'ll be\\nback, i hope, before too long.\"\\n\\n\"and when they do,\" said the industrialist, energetically, \"i will keep\\nmy part of the agreement. what is more i will move sky and earth to have\\nthe world accept them. i was entirely wrong, doctor. creatures that\\nwould refuse to harm children, under such provocation as they received,\\nare admirable. but you know--i almost hate to say this--\"\\n\\n\"say what?\"\\n\\n\"the kids. yours and mine. i\\'m almost proud of them. imagine seizing\\nthese creatures, feeding them or trying to, and keeping them hidden. the\\namazing gall of it. red told me it was his idea to get a job in a circus\\non the strength of them. imagine!\"\\n\\nthe astronomer said, \"youth!\"\\n\\n\\nxiii\\n\\nthe merchant said, \"will we be taking off soon?\"\\n\\n\"half an hour,\" said the explorer.\\n\\nit was going to be a lonely trip back. all the remaining seventeen of\\nthe crew were dead and their ashes were to be left on a strange planet.\\nback they would go with a limping ship and the burden of the controls\\nentirely on himself.\\n\\nthe merchant said, \"it was a good business stroke, not harming the young\\nones. we will get very good terms; _very_ good terms.\"\\n\\nthe explorer thought: business!\\n\\nthe merchant then said, \"they\\'ve lined up to see us off. all of them.\\nyou don\\'t think they\\'re too close, do you? it would be bad to burn any\\nof them with the rocket blast at this stage of the game.\"\\n\\n\"they\\'re safe.\"\\n\\n\"horrible-looking things, aren\\'t they?\"\\n\\n\"pleasant enough, inside. their thoughts are perfectly friendly.\"\\n\\n\"you wouldn\\'t believe it of them. that immature one, the one that first\\npicked us up--\"\\n\\n\"they call him red,\" provided the explorer.\\n\\n\"that\\'s a queer name for a monster. makes me laugh. he actually feels\\n_bad_ that we\\'re leaving. only i can\\'t make out exactly why. the nearest\\ni can come to it is something about a lost opportunity with some\\norganization or other that i can\\'t quite interpret.\"\\n\\n\"a circus,\" said the explorer, briefly.\\n\\n\"what? why, the impertinent monstrosity.\"\\n\\n\"why not? what would you have done if you had found _him_ wandering on\\n_your_ native world; found him sleeping on a field on earth, red\\ntentacles, six legs, pseudopods and all?\"\\n\\n\\nxiv\\n\\nred watched the ship leave. his red tentacles, which gave him his\\nnickname, quivered their regret at lost opportunity to the very last,\\nand the eyes at their tips filled with drifting yellowish crystals that\\nwere the equivalent of earthly tears.\\n'"

could  never  show          their  new  pets  to  their  parents      illustration      there  was  a  spatter  of  pebbles  against  the  window  and  the  youngster  stirred  in  his  sleep  another  and  he  was  awake    he  sat  up  stiffly  in  bed  seconds  passed  while  he  interpreted  his  strange  surroundings  he  wasnt  in  his  own  home  of  course  this  was  out  in  the  country  it  was  colder  than  it  should  be  and  there  was  green  at  the  window    slim    the  call  was  a  hoarse  urgent  whisper  and  the  youngster  bounded  to  the  open  window    slim  wasnt  his  real  name  but  the  new  friend  he  had  met  the  day  before  had  needed  only  one  look  at  his  slight  figure  to  say  youre  slim  he  added  im  red    red  wasnt  his  real  name  either  but  its  appropriateness  was  obvious  they  were  friends  instantly  with  the  quick  unquestioning  friendship  of  young  ones  not  yet  quite  in  adolescence  before  even  the  first  stains  of  adulthood  began  to  make  their  appearance    slim  cried  hi  red  and  waved  cheerfully  still  blinking  the  sleep  out  of  himself    red  kept  to  his  croaking  whisper  quiet  you  want  to  wake  somebody    slim  noticed  all  at  once  that  the  sun  scarcely  topped  the  low  hills  in  the  east  that  the  shadows  were  long  and  soft  and  that  the  grass  was  wet    slim  said  more  softly  whats  the  matter    red  only  waved  for  him  to  come  out    slim  dressed  quickly  gladly  confining  his  morning  wash  to  the  momentary  sprinkle  of  a  little  lukewarm  water  he  let  the  air  dry  the  exposed  portions  of  his  body  as  he  ran  out  while  bare  skin  grew  wet  against  the  dewy  grass    red  said  youve  got  to  be  quiet  if  mom  wakes  up  or  dad  or  your  dad  or  even  any  of  the  hands  then  itll  be  come  on  in  or  youll  catch  your  death  of  cold    he  mimicked  voice  and  tone  faithfully  so  that  slim  laughed  and  thought  that  there  had  never  been  so  funny  a  fellow  as  red    slim  said  eagerly  do  you  come  out  here  every  day  like  this  red  real  early  its  like  the  whole  world  is  just  yours  isnt  it  red  no  one  else  around  and  all  like  that  he  felt  proud  at  being  allowed  entrance  into  this  private  world    red  stared  at  him  sidelong  he  said  carelessly  ive  been  up  for  hours  didnt  you  hear  it  last  night    hear  what    thunder    was  there  a  thunderstorm  slim  never  slept  through  a  thunderstorm    i  guess  not  but  there  was  thunder  i  heard  it  and  then  i  went  to  the  window  and  it  wasnt  raining  it  was  all  stars  and  the  sky  was  just  getting  sort  of  almost  gray  you  know  what  i  mean    slim  had  never  seen  it  so  but  he  nodded    so  i  just  thought  id  go  out  said  red    they  walked  along  the  grassy  side  of  the  concrete  road  that  split  the  panorama  right  down  the  middle  all  the  way  down  to  where  it  vanished  among  the  hills  it  was  so  old  that  reds  father  couldnt  tell  red  when  it  had  been  built  it  didnt  have  a  crack  or  a  rough  spot  in  it    red  said  can  you  keep  a  secret    sure  red  what  kind  of  a  secret    just  a  secret  maybe  ill  tell  you  and  maybe  i  wont  i  dont  know  yet  red  broke  a  long  supple  stem  from  a  fern  they  passed  methodically  stripped  it  of  its  leaflets  and  swung  what  was  left  whipfashion  for  a  moment  he  was  on  a  wild  charger  which  reared  and  champed  under  his  iron  control  then  he  got  tired  tossed  the  whip  aside  and  stowed  the  charger  away  in  a  corner  of  his  imagination  for  future  use    he  said  therell  be  a  circus  around    slim  said  thats  no  secret  i  knew  that  my  dad  told  me  even  before  we  came  here    thats  not  the  secret  fine  secret  ever  see  a  circus    oh  sure  you  bet    like  it    say  there  isnt  anything  i  like  better    red  was  watching  out  of  the  corner  of  his  eyes  again  ever  think  you  would  like  to  be  with  a  circus  i  mean  for  good    slim  considered  i  guess  not  i  think  ill  be  an  astronomer  like  my  dad  i  think  he  wants  me  to  be    huh  astronomer  said  red    slim  felt  the  doors  of  the  new  private  world  closing  on  him  and  astronomy  became  a  thing  of  dead  stars  and  black  empty  space    he  said  placatingly  a  circus  would  be  more  fun    youre  just  saying  that    no  im  not  i  mean  it    red  grew  argumentative  suppose  you  had  a  chance  to  join  the  circus  right  now  what  would  you  do    ii    see  red  affected  scornful  laughter    slim  was  stung  id  join  up    go  on    try  me    red  whirled  at  him  strange  and  intense  you  meant  that  you  want  to  go  in  with  me    illustration    what  do  you  mean  slim  stepped  back  a  bit  surprised  by  the  unexpected  challenge    i  got  something  that  can  get  us  into  the  circus  maybe  someday  we  can  even  have  a  circus  of  our  own  we  could  be  the  biggest  circusfellows  in  the  world  thats  if  you  want  to  go  in  with  me  otherwisewell  i  guess  i  can  do  it  on  my  own  i  just  thought  lets  give  good  old  slim  a  chance    the  world  was  strange  and  glamorous  and  slim  said  sure  thing  red  im  in  what  is  it  huh  red  tell  me  what  it  is    figure  it  out  whats  the  most  important  thing  in  circuses    slim  thought  desperately  he  wanted  to  give  the  right  answer  finally  he  said  acrobats    holy  smokes  i  wouldnt  go  five  steps  to  look  at  acrobats    i  dont  know  then    animals  thats  what  whats  the  best  sideshow  where  are  the  biggest  crowds  even  in  the  main  rings  the  best  acts  are  animal  acts  there  was  no  doubt  in  reds  voice    do  you  think  so    everyone  thinks  so  you  ask  anyone  anyway  i  found  animals  this  morning  two  of  them    and  youve  got  them    sure  thats  the  secret  are  you  telling    of  course  not    okay  ive  got  them  in  the  barn  do  you  want  to  see  them    they  were  almost  at  the  barn  its  huge  open  door  black  too  black  they  had  been  heading  there  all  the  time  slim  stopped  in  his  tracks    he  tried  to  make  his  words  casual  are  they  big    would  i  fool  with  them  if  they  were  big  they  cant  hurt  you  theyre  only  about  so  long  ive  got  them  in  a  cage    they  were  in  the  barn  now  and  slim  saw  the  large  cage  suspended  from  a  hook  in  the  roof  it  was  covered  with  stiff  canvas    red  said  we  used  to  have  some  bird  there  or  something  anyway  they  cant  get  away  from  there  come  on  lets  go  up  to  the  loft    they  clambered  up  the  wooden  stairs  and  red  hooked  the  cage  toward  them    slim  pointed  and  said  theres  sort  of  a  hole  in  the  canvas    red  frowned  howd  that  get  there  he  lifted  the  canvas  looked  in  and  said  with  relief  theyre  still  there    the  canvas  appeared  to  be  burned  worried  slim    you  want  to  look  or  dont  you    slim  nodded  slowly  he  wasnt  sure  he  wanted  to  after  all  they  might  be    but  the  canvas  had  been  jerked  off  and  there  they  were  two  of  them  the  way  red  said  they  were  small  and  sort  of  disgustinglooking  the  animals  moved  quickly  as  the  canvas  lifted  and  were  on  the  side  toward  the  youngsters  red  poked  a  cautious  finger  at  them    watch  out  said  slim  in  agony    they  dont  hurt  you  said  red  ever  see  anything  like  them    no    cant  you  see  how  a  circus  would  jump  at  a  chance  to  have  these    maybe  theyre  too  small  for  a  circus    red  looked  annoyed  he  let  go  the  cage  which  swung  back  and  forth  pendulumfashion  youre  just  trying  to  back  out  arent  you    no  im  not  its  just    theyre  not  too  small  dont  worry  right  now  ive  only  got  one  worry    whats  that    well  ive  got  to  keep  them  till  the  circus  comes  dont  i  ive  got  to  figure  out  what  to  feed  them  meanwhile    the  cage  swung  and  the  little  trapped  creatures  clung  to  its  bars  gesturing  at  the  youngsters  with  queer  quick  motionsalmost  as  though  they  were  intelligent      ii    the  astronomer  entered  the  dining  room  with  decorum  he  felt  very  much  the  guest    he  said  where  are  the  youngsters  my  son  isnt  in  his  room    the  industrialist  smiled  theyve  been  out  for  hours  however  breakfast  was  forced  into  them  among  the  women  some  time  ago  so  there  is  nothing  to  worry  about  youth  doctor  youth    youth  the  word  seemed  to  depress  the  astronomer    they  ate  breakfast  in  silence  the  industrialist  said  once  you  really  think  theyll  come  the  day  looks  sonormal    the  astronomer  said  theyll  come    that  was  all    afterward  the  industrialist  said  youll  pardon  me  i  cant  conceive  your  playing  so  elaborate  a  hoax  you  really  spoke  to  them    as  i  speak  to  you  at  least  in  a  sense  they  can  project  thoughts    i  gathered  that  must  be  so  from  your  letter  how  i  wonder    i  could  not  say  i  asked  them  and  of  course  they  were  vague  or  perhaps  it  was  just  that  i  could  not  understand  it  involves  a  projector  for  the  focussing  of  thought  and  even  more  than  that  conscious  attention  on  the  part  of  both  projector  and  receptor  it  was  quite  a  while  before  i  realized  they  were  trying  to  think  at  me  such  thoughtprojectors  may  be  part  of  the  science  they  will  give  us    perhaps  said  the  industrialist  yet  think  of  the  changes  it  would  bring  to  society  a  thoughtprojector    why  not  change  would  be  good  for  us    i  dont  think  so    it  is  only  in  old  age  that  change  is  unwelcome  said  the  astronomer  and  races  can  be  old  as  well  as  individuals    the  industrialist  pointed  out  the  window  you  see  that  road  it  was  built  beforethewars  i  dont  know  exactly  when  it  is  as  good  now  as  the  day  it  was  built  we  couldnt  possibly  duplicate  it  now  the  race  was  young  when  that  was  built  eh    then  yes  at  least  they  werent  afraid  of  new  things    no  i  wish  they  had  been  where  is  the  society  of  beforethewars  destroyed  doctor  what  good  were  youth  and  new  things  we  are  better  off  now  the  world  is  peaceful  and  jogs  along  the  race  goes  nowhere  but  after  all  there  is  nowhere  to  go  they  proved  that  the  men  who  built  the  road  i  will  speak  with  your  visitors  as  i  agreed  if  they  come  but  i  think  i  will  only  ask  them  to  go    the  race  is  not  going  nowhere  said  the  astronomer  earnestly  it  is  going  toward  final  destruction  my  university  has  a  smaller  student  body  each  year  fewer  books  are  written  less  work  is  done  an  old  man  sleeps  in  the  sun  and  his  days  are  peaceful  and  unchanging  but  each  day  finds  him  nearer  death  all  the  same    well  well  said  the  industrialist    no  dont  dismiss  it  listen  before  i  wrote  you  i  investigated  your  position  in  the  planetary  economy    and  you  found  me  solvent  interrupted  the  industrialist  smiling    why  yes  oh  i  see  you  are  joking  and  yetperhaps  the  joke  is  not  far  off  you  are  less  solvent  than  your  father  and  he  was  less  solvent  than  his  father  perhaps  your  son  will  no  longer  be  solvent  it  becomes  too  troublesome  for  the  planet  to  support  even  the  industries  that  still  exist  though  they  are  toothpicks  to  the  oak  trees  of  beforethewars  we  will  be  back  to  village  economy  and  then  to  what  the  caves    and  the  infusion  of  fresh  technological  knowledge  will  be  the  changing  of  all  that    not  just  the  new  knowledge  rather  the  whole  effect  of  change  of  a  broadening  of  horizons  look  sir  i  chose  you  to  approach  in  this  matter  not  only  because  you  were  rich  and  influential  with  government  officials  but  because  you  had  an  unusual  reputation  for  these  days  of  daring  to  break  with  tradition  our  people  will  resist  change  and  you  would  know  how  to  handle  them  how  to  see  to  it  thatthat    that  the  youth  of  the  race  is  revived    yes    with  its  atomic  bombs    the  atomic  bombs  returned  the  astronomer  need  not  be  the  end  of  civilization  these  visitors  of  mine  had  their  atomic  bomb  or  whatever  their  equivalent  was  on  their  own  worlds  and  survived  it  because  they  didnt  give  up  dont  you  see  it  wasnt  the  bomb  that  defeated  us  but  our  own  shell  shock  this  may  be  the  last  chance  to  reverse  the  process    illustration    tell  me  said  the  industrialist  what  do  these  friends  from  space  want  in  return    the  astronomer  hesitated  he  said  i  will  be  truthful  with  you  they  come  from  a  denser  planet  ours  is  richer  in  the  lighter  atoms    they  want  magnesium  aluminum    no  sir  carbon  and  hydrogen  they  want  coal  and  oil    really    the  astronomer  said  quickly  you  are  going  to  ask  why  creatures  who  have  mastered  space  travel  and  therefore  atomic  power  would  want  coal  and  oil  i  cant  answer  that    the  industrialist  smiled  but  i  can  this  is  the  best  evidence  yet  of  the  truth  of  your  story  superficially  atomic  power  would  seem  to  preclude  the  use  of  coal  and  oil  however  quite  apart  from  the  energy  gained  by  their  combustion  they  remain  and  always  will  remain  the  basic  raw  material  for  all  organic  chemistry  plastics  dyes  pharmaceuticals  solvents  industry  could  not  exist  without  them  even  in  an  atomic  age  still  if  coal  and  oil  are  the  low  price  for  which  they  would  sell  us  the  troubles  and  tortures  of  racial  youth  my  answer  is  that  the  commodity  would  be  dear  if  offered  gratis    the  astronomer  sighed  and  said  there  are  the  boys    they  were  visible  through  the  open  window  standing  together  in  the  grassy  field  and  lost  in  animated  conversation  the  industrialists  son  pointed  imperiously  and  the  astronomers  son  nodded  and  made  off  at  a  run  toward  the  house    the  industrialist  said  there  is  the  youth  you  speak  of  our  race  has  as  much  of  it  as  it  ever  had    yes  but  we  age  them  quickly  and  pour  them  into  the  mold    slim  scuttled  into  the  room  the  door  banging  behind  him    the  astronomer  said  in  mild  disapproval  whats  this    slim  looked  up  in  surprise  and  came  to  a  halt  i  beg  your  pardon  i  didnt  know  anyone  was  here  i  am  sorry  to  have  interrupted  his  enunciation  was  almost  painfully  precise    the  industrialist  said  its  all  right  youngster    but  the  astronomer  said  even  if  you  had  been  entering  an  empty  room  son  there  would  be  no  cause  for  slamming  a  door    nonsense  insisted  the  industrialist  the  youngster  has  done  no  harm  you  simply  scold  him  for  being  young  you  with  your  views    he  said  to  slim  come  here  lad    slim  advanced  slowly    how  do  you  like  the  country  eh    very  much  sir  thank  you    my  son  has  been  showing  you  about  the  place  has  he    yes  sir  redi  mean    no  no  call  him  red  i  call  him  that  myself  now  tell  me  what  are  you  two  up  to  eh    slim  looked  away  whyjust  exploring  sir    the  industrialist  turned  to  the  astronomer  there  you  are  youthful  curiosity  and  adventurelust  the  race  has  not  yet  lost  it    slim  said  sir    yes  lad    the  youngster  took  a  long  time  in  getting  on  with  it  he  said  red  sent  me  in  for  something  good  to  eat  but  i  dont  exactly  know  what  he  meant  i  didnt  like  to  say  so    why  just  ask  cook  shell  have  something  good  for  younguns  to  eat    oh  no  sir  i  mean  for  animals    for  animals    yes  sir  what  do  animals  eat    the  astronomer  said  i  am  afraid  my  son  is  citybred    well  said  the  industrialist  theres  no  harm  in  that  what  kind  of  an  animal  lad    a  small  one  sir    then  try  grass  or  leaves  and  if  they  dont  want  that  nuts  or  berries  would  probably  do  the  trick    thank  you  sir  slim  ran  out  again  closing  the  door  gently  behind  him    the  astronomer  said  do  you  suppose  theyve  trapped  an  animal  alive  he  was  obviously  perturbed    thats  common  enough  theres  no  shooting  on  my  estate  and  its  tame  country  full  of  rodents  and  small  creatures  red  is  always  coming  home  with  pets  of  one  sort  or  another  they  rarely  maintain  his  interest  for  long    he  looked  at  the  wall  clock  your  friends  should  have  been  here  by  now  shouldnt  they      iii    the  swaying  had  come  to  a  halt  and  it  was  dark  the  explorer  was  not  comfortable  in  the  alien  air  it  felt  as  thick  as  soup  and  he  had  to  breathe  shallowly  even  so    he  reached  out  in  a  sudden  need  for  company  the  merchant  was  warm  to  the  touch  his  breathing  was  rough  he  moved  in  an  occasional  spasm  and  was  obviously  asleep  the  explorer  hesitated  and  decided  not  to  wake  him  it  would  serve  no  real  purpose    there  would  be  no  rescue  of  course  that  was  the  penalty  paid  for  the  high  profits  which  unrestrained  competition  could  lead  to  the  merchant  who  opened  a  new  planet  could  have  a  ten  year  monopoly  of  its  trade  which  he  might  hug  to  himself  or  more  likely  rent  out  to  all  comers  at  a  stiff  price  it  followed  that  planets  were  searched  for  in  secrecy  and  preferably  away  from  the  usual  trade  routes  in  a  case  such  as  theirs  then  there  was  little  or  no  chance  that  another  ship  would  come  within  range  of  their  subetherics  except  for  the  most  improbable  of  coincidences  even  if  they  were  in  their  ship  that  is  rather  than  in  thisthiscage    the  explorer  grasped  the  thick  bars  even  if  they  blasted  those  away  as  they  could  they  would  be  stuck  too  high  in  open  air  for  leaping    it  was  too  bad  they  had  landed  twice  before  in  the  scoutship  they  had  established  contact  with  the  natives  who  were  grotesquely  huge  but  mild  and  unaggressive  it  was  obvious  that  they  had  once  owned  a  flourishing  technology  but  hadnt  faced  up  to  the  consequences  of  such  a  technology  it  would  have  been  a  wonderful  market    and  it  was  a  tremendous  world  the  merchant  especially  had  been  taken  aback  he  had  known  the  figures  that  expressed  the  planets  diameter  but  from  a  distance  of  two  lightseconds  he  had  stood  at  the  visiplate  and  muttered  unbelievable    oh  there  are  larger  worlds  the  explorer  said  it  wouldnt  do  for  an  explorer  to  be  too  easily  impressed    inhabited    well  no    why  you  could  drop  your  planet  into  that  large  ocean  and  drown  it    the  explorer  smiled  it  was  a  gentle  dig  at  his  arcturian  homeland  which  was  smaller  than  most  planets  he  said  not  quite    the  merchant  followed  along  the  line  of  his  thoughts  and  the  inhabitants  are  large  in  proportion  to  their  world  he  sounded  as  though  the  news  struck  him  less  favorably  now    nearly  ten  times  our  height    are  you  sure  they  are  friendly    that  is  hard  to  say  friendship  between  alien  intelligences  is  an  imponderable  they  are  not  dangerous  i  think  weve  come  across  other  groups  that  could  not  maintain  equilibrium  after  the  atomic  war  stage  and  you  know  the  results  introversion  retreat  gradual  decadence  and  increasing  gentleness    even  if  they  are  such  monsters    the  principle  remains    it  was  about  then  that  the  explorer  felt  the  heavy  throbbing  of  the  engines    he  frowned  and  said  we  are  descending  a  bit  too  quickly    there  had  been  some  speculation  on  the  dangers  of  landing  some  hours  before  the  planetary  target  was  a  huge  one  for  an  oxygenwater  world  though  it  lacked  the  size  of  the  uninhabitable  hydrogenammonia  planets  and  its  low  density  made  its  surface  gravity  fairly  normal  its  gravitational  forces  fell  off  but  slowly  with  distance  in  short  its  gravitational  potential  was  high  and  the  ships  calculator  was  a  runofthemill  model  not  designed  to  plot  landing  trajectories  at  that  potential  range  that  meant  the  pilot  would  have  to  use  manual  controls    it  would  have  been  wiser  to  install  a  more  highpowered  model  but  that  would  have  meant  a  trip  to  some  outpost  of  civilization  lost  time  perhaps  a  lost  secret  the  merchant  demanded  an  immediate  landing    the  merchant  felt  it  necessary  to  defend  his  position  now  he  said  angrily  to  the  explorer  dont  you  think  the  pilot  knows  his  job  he  landed  you  safely  twice  before    yes  thought  the  explorer  in  a  scoutship  not  in  this  unmaneuverable  freighter  aloud  he  said  nothing    he  kept  his  eye  on  the  visiplate  they  were  descending  too  quickly  there  was  no  room  for  doubt  much  too  quickly    the  merchant  said  peevishly  why  do  you  keep  silence    well  then  if  you  wish  me  to  speak  i  would  suggest  that  you  strap  on  your  floater  and  help  me  prepare  the  ejector    the  pilot  fought  a  noble  fight  he  was  no  beginner  the  atmosphere  abnormally  high  and  thick  in  the  gravitational  potential  of  this  world  whipped  and  burned  about  the  ship  but  to  the  very  last  it  looked  as  though  he  might  bring  it  under  control  despite  that    he  even  maintained  course  following  the  extrapolated  line  to  the  point  on  the  northern  continent  toward  which  they  were  headed  under  other  circumstances  with  a  shade  more  luck  the  story  would  eventually  have  been  told  and  retold  as  a  heroic  and  masterly  reversal  of  a  lost  situation  but  within  sight  of  victory  tired  body  and  tired  nerves  clamped  a  control  bar  with  a  shade  too  much  pressure  the  ship  which  had  almost  levelled  off  dipped  down  again    there  was  no  room  to  retrieve  the  final  error  there  was  only  a  mile  left  to  fall  the  pilot  remained  at  his  post  to  the  actual  landing  his  only  thought  that  of  breaking  the  force  of  the  crash  of  maintaining  the  spaceworthiness  of  the  vessel  he  did  not  survive  with  the  ship  bucking  madly  in  a  soupy  atmosphere  few  ejectors  could  be  mobilized  and  only  one  of  them  in  time    when  afterwards  the  explorer  lifted  out  of  unconsciousness  and  rose  to  his  feet  he  had  the  definite  feeling  that  but  for  himself  and  the  merchant  there  were  no  survivors  and  perhaps  that  was  an  overcalculation  his  floater  had  burnt  out  while  still  sufficiently  distant  from  surface  to  have  the  fall  stun  him  the  merchant  might  have  had  less  luck  even  than  that    he  was  surrounded  by  a  world  of  thick  ropy  stalks  of  grass  and  in  the  distance  were  trees  that  reminded  him  vaguely  of  similar  structures  on  his  native  arcturian  world  except  that  their  lowest  branches  were  high  above  what  he  would  consider  normal  treetops    he  called  his  voice  sounding  basso  in  the  thick  air  and  the  merchant  answered  the  explorer  made  his  way  toward  him  thrusting  violently  at  the  coarse  stalks  that  barred  his  path    are  you  hurt  he  asked    the  merchant  grimaced  ive  sprained  something  it  hurts  to  walk    the  explorer  probed  gently  i  dont  think  anything  is  broken  youll  have  to  walk  despite  the  pain    cant  we  rest  first    its  important  to  try  to  find  the  ship  if  it  is  spaceworthy  or  if  it  can  be  repaired  we  may  live  otherwise  we  wont    just  a  few  minutes  let  me  catch  my  breath    the  explorer  was  glad  enough  for  those  few  minutes  the  merchants  eyes  were  already  closed  he  allowed  his  to  do  the  same    he  heard  the  trampling  and  his  eyes  snapped  open  never  sleep  on  a  strange  planet  he  told  himself  futilely    the  merchant  was  awake  too  and  his  steady  screaming  was  a  rumble  of  terror    the  explorer  called  its  only  a  native  of  this  planet  it  wont  harm  you    but  even  as  he  spoke  the  giant  had  swooped  down  and  in  a  moment  they  were  in  its  grasp  being  lifted  closer  to  its  monstrous  ugliness    the  merchant  struggled  violently  and  of  course  quite  futilely  cant  you  talk  to  it  he  yelled    the  explorer  could  only  shake  his  head  i  cant  reach  it  with  the  projector  it  wont  be  listening    then  blast  it  blast  it  down    we  cant  do  that  the  phrase  you  fool  had  almost  been  added  the  explorer  struggled  to  keep  his  selfcontrol  they  were  swallowing  space  as  the  monster  moved  purposefully  away    why  not  cried  the  merchant  you  can  reach  your  blaster  i  see  it  in  plain  sight  dont  be  afraid  of  falling    its  simpler  than  that  if  this  monster  is  killed  youll  never  trade  with  this  planet  youll  never  even  leave  it  you  probably  wont  live  the  day  out    why  why    because  this  is  one  of  the  young  of  the  species  you  should  know  what  happens  when  a  trader  kills  a  native  young  even  accidentally  whats  more  if  this  is  the  targetpoint  then  we  are  on  the  estate  of  a  powerful  native  this  might  be  one  of  his  brood    that  was  how  they  entered  their  present  prison  they  had  carefully  burnt  away  a  portion  of  the  thick  stiff  covering  and  it  was  obvious  that  the  height  from  which  they  were  suspended  was  a  killing  one    now  once  again  the  prisoncage  shuddered  and  lifted  in  an  upward  arc  the  merchant  rolled  to  the  lower  rim  and  startled  awake  the  cover  lifted  and  light  flooded  in  as  was  the  case  the  time  before  there  were  two  specimens  of  the  young  they  were  not  very  different  in  appearance  from  adults  of  the  species  reflected  the  explorer  though  of  course  they  were  considerably  smaller    a  handful  of  reedy  green  stalks  was  stuffed  between  the  bars  its  odor  was  not  unpleasant  but  it  carried  clods  of  soil  at  its  ends    the  merchant  drew  away  and  said  huskily  what  are  they  doing    the  explorer  said  trying  to  feed  us  i  should  judge  at  least  this  seems  to  be  the  native  equivalent  of  grass    the  cover  was  replaced  and  they  were  set  swinging  again  alone  with  their  fodder      iv    slim  started  at  the  sound  of  footsteps  and  brightened  when  it  turned  out  to  be  only  red    he  said  no  ones  around  i  had  my  eye  peeled  you  bet    red  said  ssh  look  you  take  this  stuff  and  stick  it  in  the  cage  ive  got  to  scoot  back  to  the  house    what  is  it  slim  reached  reluctantly    ground  meat  holy  smokes  havent  you  ever  seen  ground  meat  thats  what  you  shouldve  got  when  i  sent  you  to  the  house  instead  of  coming  back  with  that  stupid  grass    slim  was  hurt  howd  i  know  they  dont  eat  grass  besides  ground  meat  doesnt  come  loose  like  that  it  comes  in  cellophane  and  it  isnt  that  color    surein  the  city  out  here  we  grind  our  own  and  its  always  this  color  till  its  cooked    you  mean  it  isnt  cooked  slim  drew  away  quickly    red  looked  disgusted  do  you  think  animals  eat  cooked  food  come  on  take  it  it  wont  hurt  you  i  tell  you  there  isnt  much  time    why  whats  doing  back  at  the  house    i  dont  know  dad  and  your  father  are  walking  around  i  think  maybe  theyre  looking  for  me  maybe  the  cook  told  them  i  took  the  meat  anyway  we  dont  want  them  coming  here  after  me    didnt  you  ask  the  cook  before  you  took  this  stuff    who  that  crab  shouldnt  wonder  if  she  only  let  me  have  a  drink  of  water  because  dad  makes  her  come  on  take  it    slim  took  the  large  glob  of  meat  though  his  skin  crawled  at  the  touch  he  turned  toward  the  barn  and  red  sped  away  in  the  direction  from  which  he  had  come    he  slowed  when  he  approached  the  two  adults  took  a  few  deep  breaths  to  bring  himself  back  to  normal  and  then  carefully  and  nonchalantly  sauntered  past  they  were  walking  in  the  general  direction  of  the  barn  he  noticed  but  not  dead  on    he  said  hi  dad  hello  sir    the  industrialist  said  just  a  moment  red  i  have  a  question  to  ask  you    red  turned  a  carefully  blank  face  to  his  father  yes  dad    mother  tells  me  you  were  out  early  this  morning    not  real  early  dad  just  a  little  before  breakfast    she  said  you  told  her  it  was  because  you  had  been  awakened  during  the  night  and  didnt  go  back  to  sleep    red  waited  before  answering  should  he  have  told  mom  that    then  he  said  yes  sir    what  was  it  that  awakened  you    red  saw  no  harm  in  it  he  said  i  dont  know  dad  it  sounded  like  thunder  sort  of  and  like  a  collision  sort  of    could  you  tell  where  it  came  from    it  sounded  like  it  was  out  by  the  hill  that  was  truthful  and  useful  as  well  since  the  direction  was  almost  opposite  that  in  which  the  barn  lay    the  industrialist  looked  at  his  guest  i  suppose  it  would  do  no  harm  to  walk  toward  the  hill    the  astronomer  said  i  am  ready    red  watched  them  walk  away  and  when  he  turned  he  saw  slim  peering  cautiously  out  from  among  the  briars  of  a  hedge    red  waved  at  him  come  on    slim  stepped  out  and  approached  did  they  say  anything  about  the  meat    no  i  guess  they  dont  know  about  that  they  went  down  to  the  hill    what  for    search  me  they  kept  asking  about  the  noise  i  heard  listen  did  the  animals  eat  the  meat    well  said  slim  cautiously  they  were  sort  of  looking  at  it  and  smelling  it  or  something    okay  red  said  i  guess  theyll  eat  it  holy  smokes  theyve  got  to  eat  something  lets  walk  along  toward  the  hill  and  see  what  dad  and  your  father  are  going  to  do    what  about  the  animals    theyll  be  all  right  a  fellow  cant  spend  all  his  time  on  them  did  you  give  them  water    sure  they  drank  that    see  come  on  well  look  at  them  after  lunch  i  tell  you  what  well  bring  them  fruit  anythingll  eat  fruit    together  they  trotted  up  the  rise  red  as  usual  in  the  lead      v    the  astronomer  said  you  think  the  noise  was  their  ship  landing    dont  you  think  it  could  be    if  it  were  they  may  all  be  dead    perhaps  not  the  industrialist  frowned    if  they  have  landed  and  are  still  alive  where  are  they    think  about  that  for  a  while  he  was  still  frowning    the  astronomer  said  i  dont  understand  you    they  may  not  be  friendly    oh  no  ive  spoken  with  them  theyve    youve  spoken  with  them  call  that  reconnaissance  what  would  their  next  step  be  invasion    but  they  only  have  one  ship  sir    you  know  that  only  because  they  say  so  they  might  have  a  fleet    ive  told  you  about  their  size  they    their  size  would  not  matter  if  they  have  handweapons  that  may  well  be  superior  to  our  artillery    that  is  not  what  i  meant    i  had  this  partly  in  mind  from  the  first  the  industrialist  went  on  it  is  for  that  reason  i  agreed  to  see  them  after  i  received  your  letter  not  to  agree  to  an  unsettling  and  impossible  trade  but  to  judge  their  real  purposes  i  did  not  count  on  their  evading  the  meeting    he  sighed  i  suppose  it  isnt  our  fault  you  are  right  in  one  thing  at  any  rate  the  world  has  been  at  peace  too  long  we  are  losing  a  healthy  sense  of  suspicion    the  astronomers  mild  voice  rose  to  an  unusual  pitch  and  he  said  i  will  speak  i  tell  you  that  there  is  no  reason  to  suppose  they  can  possibly  be  hostile  they  are  small  yes  but  that  is  only  important  because  it  is  a  reflection  of  the  fact  that  their  native  worlds  are  small  our  world  has  what  is  for  them  a  normal  gravity  but  because  of  our  much  higher  gravitational  potential  our  atmosphere  is  too  dense  to  support  them  comfortably  over  sustained  periods  for  a  similar  reason  the  use  of  the  world  as  a  base  for  interstellar  travel  except  for  trade  in  certain  items  is  uneconomical  and  there  are  important  differences  in  chemistry  of  life  due  to  the  basic  differences  in  soils  they  couldnt  eat  our  food  or  we  theirs    surely  all  this  can  be  overcome  they  can  bring  their  own  food  build  domed  stations  of  lowered  air  pressure  devise  specially  designed  ships    they  can  and  how  glibly  you  can  describe  feats  that  are  easy  to  a  race  in  its  youth  it  is  simply  that  they  dont  have  to  do  any  of  that  there  are  millions  of  worlds  suitable  for  them  in  the  galaxy  they  dont  need  this  one  which  isnt    how  do  you  know  all  this  is  their  information  again    this  i  was  able  to  check  independently  i  am  an  astronomer  after  all    that  is  true  let  me  hear  what  you  have  to  say  then  while  we  walk    then  sir  consider  that  for  a  long  time  our  astronomers  have  believed  that  two  general  classes  of  planetary  bodies  existed  first  the  planets  which  formed  at  distances  far  enough  from  their  stellar  nucleus  to  become  cool  enough  to  capture  hydrogen  these  would  be  large  planets  rich  in  hydrogen  ammonia  and  methane  we  have  examples  of  these  in  the  giant  outer  planets  the  second  class  would  include  those  planets  formed  so  near  the  stellar  center  that  the  high  temperature  would  make  it  impossible  to  capture  much  hydrogen  these  would  be  smaller  planets  comparatively  poorer  in  hydrogen  and  richer  in  oxygen  we  know  that  type  very  well  since  we  live  on  one  ours  is  the  only  solar  system  we  know  in  detail  however  and  it  has  been  reasonable  for  us  to  assume  that  these  were  the  only  two  planetary  classes    i  take  it  then  that  there  is  another    yes  there  is  a  superdense  class  still  smaller  poorer  in  hydrogen  than  the  inner  planets  of  the  solar  system  the  ratio  of  occurrence  of  hydrogenammonia  planets  and  these  superdense  wateroxygen  worlds  of  theirs  over  the  entire  galaxyand  remember  that  they  have  actually  conducted  a  survey  of  significant  sample  volumes  of  the  galaxy  which  we  without  interstellar  travel  cannot  dois  about  3  to  1  this  leaves  them  seven  million  superdense  worlds  for  exploration  and  colonization    the  industrialist  looked  at  the  blue  sky  and  the  greencovered  trees  among  which  they  were  making  their  way  he  said  and  worlds  like  ours    the  astronomer  said  softly  ours  is  the  first  solar  system  they  have  found  which  contains  them  apparently  the  development  of  our  solar  system  was  unique  and  did  not  follow  the  ordinary  rules    the  industrialist  considered  that  what  it  amounts  to  is  that  these  creatures  from  space  are  asteroiddwellers    no  no  the  asteroids  are  something  else  again  they  occur  i  was  told  in  one  out  of  eight  stellar  systems  but  theyre  completely  different  from  what  weve  been  discussing    and  how  does  your  being  an  astronomer  change  the  fact  that  you  are  still  only  quoting  their  unsupported  statements    but  they  did  not  restrict  themselves  to  bald  items  of  information  they  presented  me  with  a  theory  of  stellar  evolution  which  i  had  to  accept  and  which  is  more  nearly  valid  than  anything  our  own  astronomy  has  ever  been  able  to  devise  if  we  except  possible  lost  theories  dating  from  beforethewars  mind  you  their  theory  had  a  rigidly  mathematical  development  and  it  predicted  just  such  a  galaxy  as  they  describe  so  you  see  they  have  all  the  worlds  they  wish  they  are  not  landhungry  certainly  not  for  our  land    reason  would  say  so  if  what  you  say  is  true  but  creatures  may  be  intelligent  and  not  reasonable  our  forefathers  were  presumably  intelligent  yet  they  were  certainly  not  reasonable  was  it  reasonable  to  destroy  almost  all  their  tremendous  civilization  in  atomic  warfare  over  causes  our  historians  can  no  longer  accurately  determine  the  industrialist  brooded  over  it  from  the  dropping  of  the  first  atom  bomb  over  those  islandsi  forget  the  ancient  namethere  was  only  one  end  in  sight  and  in  plain  sight  yet  events  were  allowed  to  proceed  to  that  end    he  looked  up  said  briskly  well  where  are  we  i  wonder  if  we  are  not  on  a  fools  errand  after  all    but  the  astronomer  was  a  little  in  advance  and  his  voice  came  thickly  no  fools  errand  sir  look  there      vi    red  and  slim  had  trailed  their  elders  with  the  experience  of  youth  aided  by  the  absorption  and  anxiety  of  their  fathers  their  view  of  the  final  object  of  the  search  was  somewhat  obscured  by  the  underbrush  behind  which  they  remained    red  said  holy  smokes  look  at  that  its  all  shiny  silver  or  something    but  it  was  slim  who  was  really  excited  he  caught  at  the  other  i  know  what  this  is  its  a  spaceship  that  must  be  why  my  father  came  here  hes  one  of  the  biggest  astronomers  in  the  world  and  your  father  would  have  to  call  him  if  a  spaceship  landed  on  his  estate    what  are  you  talking  about  dad  didnt  even  know  that  thing  was  there  he  only  came  here  because  i  told  him  i  heard  the  thunder  from  here  besides  there  isnt  any  such  thing  as  a  spaceship    sure  there  is  look  at  it  see  those  round  things  they  are  ports  and  you  can  see  the  rocket  tubes    how  do  you  know  so  much    slim  was  flushed  he  said  i  read  about  them  my  father  has  books  about  them  old  books  from  beforethewars    huh  now  i  know  youre  making  it  up  books  from  beforethewars    my  father  has  to  have  them  he  teaches  at  the  university  its  his  job    his  voice  had  risen  and  red  had  to  pull  at  him  you  want  them  to  hear  us  he  whispered  indignantly    well  it  is  too  a  spaceship    look  here  slim  you  mean  thats  a  ship  from  another  world    its  got  to  be  look  at  my  father  going  round  and  round  it  he  wouldnt  be  so  interested  if  it  was  anything  else    other  worlds  where  are  there  other  worlds    everywhere  how  about  the  planets  theyre  worlds  just  like  ours  some  of  them  and  other  stars  probably  have  planets  theres  probably  zillions  of  planets    red  felt  outweighed  and  outnumbered  he  muttered  youre  crazy    all  right  then  ill  show  you    hey  where  are  you  going    down  there  im  going  to  ask  my  father  i  suppose  youll  believe  it  if  he  tells  you  i  suppose  youll  believe  a  professor  of  astronomy  knows  what    he  had  scrambled  upright    red  said  hey  you  dont  want  them  to  see  us  were  not  supposed  to  be  here  do  you  want  them  to  start  asking  questions  and  find  out  about  our  animals    i  dont  care  you  said  i  was  crazy    snitcher  you  promised  you  wouldnt  tell    im  not  going  to  tell  but  if  they  find  out  themselves  its  your  fault  for  starting  an  argument  and  saying  i  was  crazy    i  take  it  back  then  grumbled  red    well  all  right  you  better    in  a  way  slim  was  disappointed  he  wanted  to  see  the  spaceship  at  closer  quarters  still  he  could  not  break  his  vow  of  secrecy  even  in  spirit  without  at  least  the  excuse  of  personal  insult    red  said  its  awfully  small  for  a  spaceship    sure  because  its  probably  a  scoutship    ill  bet  dad  couldnt  even  get  into  the  old  thing    so  much  slim  realized  to  be  true  it  was  a  weak  point  in  his  argument  and  he  made  no  answer  his  interest  was  absorbed  by  the  adults    red  rose  to  his  feet  an  elaborate  attitude  of  boredom  all  about  him  well  i  guess  we  better  be  going  theres  business  to  do  and  i  cant  spend  all  day  here  looking  at  some  old  spaceship  or  whatever  it  is  weve  got  to  take  care  of  the  animals  if  were  going  to  be  circusfolks  thats  the  first  rule  with  circusfolks  theyve  got  to  take  care  of  the  animals  and  he  finished  virtuously  thats  what  i  aim  to  do  anyway    slim  said  what  for  red  theyve  got  plenty  of  meat  lets  watch    theres  no  fun  in  watching  besides  dad  and  your  father  are  going  away  and  i  guess  its  about  lunch  time    red  became  argumentative  look  slim  we  cant  start  acting  suspicious  or  theyre  going  to  start  investigating  holy  smokes  dont  you  ever  read  any  detective  stories  when  youre  trying  to  work  a  big  deal  without  being  caught  its  practically  the  main  thing  to  keep  on  acting  just  like  always  then  they  dont  suspect  anything  thats  the  first  law    oh  all  right    slim  rose  resentfully  at  the  moment  the  circus  appeared  to  him  a  rather  tawdry  and  shoddy  substitute  for  the  glories  of  astronomy  and  he  wondered  how  he  had  come  to  fall  in  with  reds  silly  scheme    down  the  slope  they  went  slim  as  usual  in  the  rear      vii    the  industrialist  said  its  the  workmanship  that  gets  me  i  never  saw  such  construction    what  good  is  it  now  said  the  astronomer  bitterly  theres  nothing  left  therell  be  no  second  landing  this  ship  detected  life  on  our  planet  through  accident  other  exploring  parties  would  come  no  closer  than  necessary  to  establish  the  fact  that  there  were  no  superdense  worlds  existing  in  our  solar  system    well  theres  no  quarreling  with  a  crash  landing    the  ship  hardly  seems  damaged  if  only  some  had  survived  the  ship  might  have  been  repaired    if  they  had  survived  there  would  be  no  trade  in  any  case  theyre  too  different  too  disturbing  in  any  caseits  over    they  entered  the  house  and  the  industrialist  greeted  his  wife  calmly  lunch  about  ready  dear    im  afraid  not  you  see  she  looked  hesitantly  at  the  astronomer    is  anything  wrong  asked  the  industrialist  why  not  tell  me  im  sure  our  guest  wont  mind  a  little  family  discussion    pray  dont  pay  any  attention  whatever  to  me  muttered  the  astronomer  he  moved  miserably  to  the  other  end  of  the  living  room    the  woman  said  in  low  hurried  tones  really  dear  cooks  that  upset  ive  been  soothing  her  for  hours  and  honestly  i  dont  know  why  red  should  have  done  it    done  what  the  industrialist  was  more  amused  than  otherwise  it  had  taken  the  united  efforts  of  himself  and  his  son  months  to  argue  his  wife  into  using  the  name  red  rather  than  the  perfectly  ridiculous  viewed  youngster  fashion  name  which  was  his  real  one    she  said  hes  taken  most  of  the  chopped  meat    hes  eaten  it    well  i  hope  not  it  was  raw    then  what  would  he  want  it  for    i  havent  the  slightest  idea  i  havent  seen  him  since  breakfast  meanwhile  cooks  just  furious  she  caught  him  vanishing  out  the  kitchen  door  and  there  was  the  bowl  of  chopped  meat  just  about  empty  and  she  was  going  to  use  it  for  lunch  well  you  know  cook  she  had  to  change  the  lunch  menu  and  that  means  she  wont  be  worth  living  with  for  a  week  youll  just  have  to  speak  to  red  dear  and  make  him  promise  not  to  do  things  in  the  kitchen  any  more  and  it  wouldnt  hurt  to  have  him  apologize  to  cook    oh  come  she  works  for  us  if  we  dont  complain  about  a  change  in  lunch  menu  why  should  she    because  shes  the  one  who  has  doublework  made  for  her  and  shes  talking  about  quitting  good  cooks  arent  easy  to  get  do  you  remember  the  one  before  her    it  was  a  strong  argument    the  industrialist  looked  about  vaguely  he  said  i  suppose  youre  right  he  isnt  here  i  suppose  when  he  comes  in  ill  talk  to  him    youd  better  start  here  he  comes    red  walked  into  the  house  and  said  cheerfully  time  for  lunch  i  guess  he  looked  from  one  parent  to  the  other  in  quick  speculation  at  their  fixed  stares  and  said  got  to  clean  up  first  though  and  made  for  the  other  door    the  industrialist  said  one  moment  son    sir    wheres  your  little  friend    red  said  carelessly  hes  around  somewhere  we  were  just  sort  of  walking  and  i  looked  around  and  he  wasnt  there  this  was  perfectly  true  and  red  felt  on  safe  ground  i  told  him  it  was  lunch  time  i  said  i  suppose  its  about  lunch  time  i  said  we  got  to  be  getting  back  to  the  house  and  he  said  yes  and  i  just  went  on  and  then  when  i  was  about  at  the  creek  i  looked  around  and    the  astronomer  interrupted  the  voluble  story  looking  up  from  a  magazine  he  had  been  sightlessly  rummaging  through  i  wouldnt  worry  about  my  youngster  he  is  quite  selfreliant  dont  wait  lunch  for  him    lunch  isnt  ready  in  any  case  doctor  the  industrialist  turned  once  more  to  his  son  and  talking  about  that  son  the  reason  for  it  is  that  something  happened  to  the  ingredients  do  you  have  anything  to  say    sir    i  hate  to  feel  that  i  have  to  explain  myself  more  fully  why  did  you  take  the  chopped  meat    the  chopped  meat    the  chopped  meat  he  waited  patiently    red  said  well  i  was  sort  of    hungry  prompted  his  father  for  raw  meat    no  sir  i  just  sort  of  needed  it    for  what  exactly    red  looked  miserable  and  remained  silent    the  astronomer  broke  in  again  if  you  dont  mind  my  putting  in  a  few  wordsyoull  remember  that  just  after  breakfast  my  son  came  in  to  ask  what  animals  ate    oh  youre  right  how  stupid  of  me  to  forget  look  here  red  did  you  take  it  for  an  animal  pet  youve  got    red  recovered  indignant  breath  he  said  you  mean  slim  came  in  here  and  said  i  had  an  animal  he  came  in  here  and  said  that  he  said  i  had  an  animal    no  he  didnt  he  simply  asked  what  animals  ate  thats  all  now  if  he  promised  he  wouldnt  tell  on  you  he  didnt  its  your  own  foolishness  in  trying  to  take  something  without  permission  that  gave  you  away  that  happened  to  be  stealing  now  have  you  an  animal  i  ask  you  a  direct  question    yes  sir  it  was  a  whisper  so  low  as  hardly  to  be  heard    all  right  youll  have  to  get  rid  of  it  do  you  understand    reds  mother  intervened  do  you  mean  to  say  youre  keeping  a  meateating  animal  red  it  might  bite  you  and  give  you  bloodpoison    theyre  only  small  ones  quavered  red  they  hardly  budge  if  you  touch  them    they  how  many  do  you  have    two    where  are  they    the  industrialist  touched  her  arm  dont  chivvy  the  child  any  further  he  said  in  a  low  voice  if  he  says  hell  get  rid  of  them  he  will  and  thats  punishment  enough    he  dismissed  the  matter  from  his  mind      viii    lunch  was  half  over  when  slim  dashed  into  the  dining  room  for  a  moment  he  stood  abashed  and  then  he  said  in  what  was  almost  hysteria  ive  got  to  speak  to  red  ive  got  to  say  something    red  looked  up  in  fright  but  the  astronomer  said  i  dont  think  son  youre  being  very  polite  youve  kept  lunch  waiting    im  sorry  father    oh  dont  rate  the  lad  said  the  industrialists  wife  he  can  speak  to  red  if  he  wants  to  and  there  was  no  damage  done  to  the  lunch    ive  got  to  speak  to  red  alone  slim  insisted    now  thats  enough  said  the  astronomer  with  a  kind  of  gentleness  that  was  obviously  manufactured  for  the  benefit  of  strangers  and  which  had  beneath  it  an  easilyrecognized  edge  take  your  seat    slim  did  so  but  he  ate  only  when  someone  looked  directly  upon  him  even  then  he  was  not  very  successful    red  caught  his  eyes  he  made  soundless  words  did  the  animals  get  loose    slim  shook  his  head  slightly  he  whispered  no  its    the  astronomer  looked  at  him  hard  and  slim  faltered  to  a  stop    with  lunch  over  red  slipped  out  of  the  room  with  a  microscopic  motion  at  slim  to  follow    they  walked  in  silence  to  the  creek    then  red  turned  fiercely  upon  his  companion  look  here  whats  the  idea  of  telling  my  dad  we  were  feeding  animals    slim  said  i  didnt  i  asked  what  you  feed  animals  thats  not  the  same  as  saying  we  were  doing  it  besides  its  something  else  red    but  red  had  not  used  up  his  grievances  and  where  did  you  go  anyway  i  thought  you  were  coming  to  the  house  they  acted  like  it  was  my  fault  you  werent  there    but  im  trying  to  tell  you  about  that  if  youd  only  shut  up  a  second  and  let  me  talk  you  dont  give  a  fellow  a  chance    well  go  on  and  tell  me  if  youve  got  so  much  to  say    im  trying  to  i  went  back  to  the  spaceship  the  folks  werent  there  anymore  and  i  wanted  to  see  what  it  was  like    it  isnt  a  spaceship  said  red  sullenly  he  had  nothing  to  lose    it  is  too  i  looked  inside  you  could  look  through  the  ports  and  i  looked  inside  and  they  were  dead  he  looked  sick  they  were  dead    who  were  dead    slim  screeched  animals  like  our  animals  only  they  arent  animals  theyre  peoplethings  from  other  planets    for  a  moment  red  might  have  been  turned  to  stone  it  didnt  occur  to  him  to  disbelieve  slim  at  this  point  slim  looked  too  genuinely  the  bearer  of  just  such  tidings  he  said  finally  oh  my    well  what  are  we  going  to  do  golly  will  we  get  a  whopping  if  they  find  out  he  was  shivering    we  better  turn  them  loose  said  red    theyll  tell  on  us    they  cant  talk  our  language  not  if  theyre  from  another  planet    yes  they  can  because  i  remember  my  father  talking  about  some  stuff  like  that  to  my  mother  when  he  didnt  know  i  was  in  the  room  he  was  talking  about  visitors  who  could  talk  with  the  mind  telepathery  or  something  i  thought  he  was  making  it  up    well  holy  smokes  i  meanholy  smokes  red  looked  up  i  tell  you  my  dad  said  to  get  rid  of  them  lets  sort  of  bury  them  somewhere  or  throw  them  in  the  creek    he  told  you  to  do  that    he  made  me  say  i  had  animals  and  then  he  said  get  rid  of  them  i  got  to  do  what  he  says  holy  smokes  hes  my  dad    some  of  the  panic  left  slims  heart  it  was  a  thoroughly  legalistic  way  out  well  lets  do  it  right  now  then  before  they  find  out  oh  golly  if  they  find  out  will  we  be  in  trouble    they  broke  into  a  run  toward  the  barn  unspeakable  visions  in  their  minds      ix    it  was  different  looking  at  them  as  though  they  were  people  as  animals  they  had  been  interesting  as  people  horrible  their  eyes  which  were  neutral  little  objects  before  now  seemed  to  watch  them  with  active  malevolence    theyre  making  noises  said  slim  in  a  whisper  which  was  barely  audible    i  guess  theyre  talking  or  something  said  red  funny  that  those  noises  which  they  had  heard  before  had  not  had  significance  earlier  he  was  making  no  move  toward  them  neither  was  slim    the  canvas  was  off  but  they  were  just  watching  the  ground  meat  slim  noticed  hadnt  been  touched    slim  said  arent  you  going  to  do  something    arent  you    you  found  them    its  your  turn  now    no  it  isnt  you  found  them  its  your  fault  the  whole  thing  i  was  watching    you  joined  in  slim  you  know  you  did    i  dont  care  you  found  them  and  thats  what  ill  say  when  they  come  here  looking  for  us    red  said  all  right  for  you  but  the  thought  of  the  consequences  inspired  him  anyway  and  he  reached  for  the  cage  door    slim  said  wait    red  was  glad  to  he  said  now  whats  biting  you    one  of  thems  got  something  on  him  that  looks  like  it  might  be  iron  or  something    where    right  there  i  saw  it  before  but  i  thought  it  was  just  part  of  him  but  if  hes  people  maybe  its  a  disintegrator  gun    whats  that    i  read  about  it  in  the  books  from  beforethewars  mostly  people  with  spaceships  have  disintegrator  guns  they  point  them  at  you  and  you  get  disintegratored    they  didnt  point  it  at  us  till  now  pointed  out  red  with  his  heart  not  quite  in  it    i  dont  care  im  not  hanging  around  here  and  getting  disintegratored  im  getting  my  father    cowardycat  yellow  cowardycat    i  dont  care  you  can  call  all  the  names  you  want  but  if  you  bother  them  now  youll  get  disintegratored  you  wait  and  see  and  itll  be  all  your  fault    he  made  for  the  narrow  spiral  stairs  that  led  to  the  main  floor  of  the  barn  stopped  at  its  head  then  backed  away    reds  mother  was  moving  up  panting  a  little  with  the  exertion  and  smiling  a  tight  smile  for  the  benefit  of  slim  in  his  capacity  as  guest    red  you  red  are  you  up  there  now  dont  try  to  hide  i  know  this  is  where  youre  keeping  them  cook  saw  where  you  ran  with  the  meat    red  quavered  hello  ma    now  show  me  those  nasty  animals  im  going  to  see  to  it  that  you  get  rid  of  them  right  away    it  was  over  and  despite  the  imminent  corporal  punishment  red  felt  something  like  a  load  fall  from  him  at  least  the  decision  was  out  of  his  hands    right  there  ma  i  didnt  do  anything  to  them  ma  i  didnt  know  they  just  looked  like  little  animals  and  i  thought  youd  let  me  keep  them  ma  i  wouldnt  have  taken  the  meat  only  they  wouldnt  eat  grass  or  leaves  and  we  couldnt  find  good  nuts  or  berries  and  cook  never  lets  me  have  anything  or  i  would  have  asked  her  and  i  didnt  know  it  was  for  lunch  and    he  was  speaking  on  the  sheer  momentum  of  terror  and  did  not  realize  that  his  mother  did  not  hear  him  but  with  eyes  frozen  and  popping  at  the  cage  was  screaming  in  thin  piercing  tones      x    the  astronomer  was  saying  a  quiet  burial  is  all  we  can  do  there  is  no  point  in  any  publicity  now  when  they  heard  the  screams    she  had  not  entirely  recovered  by  the  time  she  reached  them  running  and  running  it  was  minutes  before  her  husband  could  extract  sense  from  her    she  was  saying  finally  i  tell  you  theyre  in  the  barn  i  dont  know  what  they  are  no  no    she  barred  the  industrialists  quick  movement  in  that  direction  she  said  dont  you  go  send  one  of  the  hands  with  a  shotgun  i  tell  you  i  never  saw  anything  like  it  little  horrible  beasts  withwithi  cant  describe  it  to  think  that  red  was  touching  them  and  trying  to  feed  them  he  was  holding  them  and  feeding  them  meat    red  began  i  only    and  slim  said  it  was  not    the  industrialist  said  quickly  now  you  boys  have  done  enough  harm  today  march  into  the  house  and  not  a  word  not  one  word  im  not  interested  in  anything  you  have  to  say  after  this  is  all  over  ill  hear  you  out  and  as  for  you  red  ill  see  that  youre  properly  punished    he  turned  to  his  wife  now  whatever  the  animals  are  well  have  them  killed  he  added  quietly  once  the  youngsters  were  out  of  hearing  come  come  the  children  arent  hurt  and  after  all  they  havent  done  anything  really  terrible  theyve  just  found  a  new  pet    the  astronomer  spoke  with  difficulty  pardon  me  maam  but  can  you  describe  these  animals    she  shook  her  head  she  was  quite  beyond  words    can  you  just  tell  me  if  they    im  sorry  said  the  industrialist  apologetically  but  i  think  i  had  better  take  care  of  her  will  you  excuse  me    a  moment  please  one  moment  she  said  she  had  never  seen  such  animals  before  surely  it  is  not  usual  to  find  animals  that  are  completely  unique  on  an  estate  such  as  this    im  sorry  lets  not  discuss  that  now    except  that  unique  animals  might  have  landed  during  the  night    the  industrialist  stepped  away  from  his  wife  what  are  you  implying    i  think  we  had  better  go  to  the  barn  sir    the  industrialist  stared  a  moment  turned  and  suddenly  and  quite  uncharacteristically  began  running  the  astronomer  followed  and  the  womans  wail  rose  unheeded  behind  them      xi    the  industrialist  stared  looked  at  the  astronomer  turned  to  stare  again    those    those  said  the  astronomer  i  have  no  doubt  we  appear  strange  and  repulsive  to  them    what  do  they  say    why  that  they  are  uncomfortable  and  tired  and  even  a  little  sick  but  that  they  are  not  seriously  damaged  and  that  the  youngsters  treated  them  well    treated  them  well  scooping  them  up  keeping  them  in  a  cage  giving  them  grass  and  raw  meat  to  eat  tell  me  how  to  speak  to  them    it  may  take  a  little  time  think  at  them  try  to  listen  it  will  come  to  you  but  perhaps  not  right  away    the  industrialist  tried  he  grimaced  with  the  effort  of  it  thinking  over  and  over  again  the  youngsters  were  ignorant  of  your  identity    and  the  thought  was  suddenly  in  his  mind  we  were  quite  aware  of  it  and  because  we  knew  they  meant  well  by  us  according  to  their  own  view  of  the  matter  we  did  not  attempt  to  attack  them    attack  them  thought  the  industrialist  and  said  it  aloud  in  his  concentration    why  yes  came  the  answering  thought  we  are  armed    one  of  the  revolting  little  creatures  in  the  cage  lifted  a  metal  object  and  there  was  a  sudden  hole  in  the  top  of  the  cage  and  another  in  the  roof  of  the  barn  each  hole  rimmed  with  charred  wood    we  hope  the  creatures  thought  it  will  not  be  too  difficult  to  make  repairs    the  industrialist  found  it  impossible  to  organize  himself  to  the  point  of  directed  thought  he  turned  to  the  astronomer  and  with  that  weapon  in  their  possession  they  let  themselves  be  handled  and  caged  i  dont  understand  it    but  the  calm  thought  came  we  would  not  harm  the  young  of  an  intelligent  species      xii    it  was  twilight  the  industrialist  had  entirely  missed  the  evening  meal  and  remained  unaware  of  the  fact    he  said  do  you  really  think  the  ship  will  fly    if  they  say  so  said  the  astronomer  im  sure  it  will  theyll  be  back  i  hope  before  too  long    and  when  they  do  said  the  industrialist  energetically  i  will  keep  my  part  of  the  agreement  what  is  more  i  will  move  sky  and  earth  to  have  the  world  accept  them  i  was  entirely  wrong  doctor  creatures  that  would  refuse  to  harm  children  under  such  provocation  as  they  received  are  admirable  but  you  knowi  almost  hate  to  say  this    say  what    the  kids  yours  and  mine  im  almost  proud  of  them  imagine  seizing  these  creatures  feeding  them  or  trying  to  and  keeping  them  hidden  the  amazing  gall  of  it  red  told  me  it  was  his  idea  to  get  a  job  in  a  circus  on  the  strength  of  them  imagine    the  astronomer  said  youth      xiii    the  merchant  said  will  we  be  taking  off  soon    half  an  hour  said  the  explorer    it  was  going  to  be  a  lonely  trip  back  all  the  remaining  seventeen  of  the  crew  were  dead  and  their  ashes  were  to  be  left  on  a  strange  planet  back  they  would  go  with  a  limping  ship  and  the  burden  of  the  controls  entirely  on  himself    the  merchant  said  it  was  a  good  business  stroke  not  harming  the  young  ones  we  will  get  very  good  terms  very  good  terms    the  explorer  thought  business    the  merchant  then  said  theyve  lined  up  to  see  us  off  all  of  them  you  dont  think  theyre  too  close  do  you  it  would  be  bad  to  burn  any  of  them  with  the  rocket  blast  at  this  stage  of  the  game    theyre  safe    horriblelooking  things  arent  they    pleasant  enough  inside  their  thoughts  are  perfectly  friendly    you  wouldnt  believe  it  of  them  that  immature  one  the  one  that  first  picked  us  up    they  call  him  red  provided  the  explorer    thats  a  queer  name  for  a  monster  makes  me  laugh  he  actually  feels  bad  that  were  leaving  only  i  cant  make  out  exactly  why  the  nearest  i  can  come  to  it  is  something  about  a  lost  opportunity  with  some  organization  or  other  that  i  cant  quite  interpret    a  circus  said  the  explorer  briefly    what  why  the  impertinent  monstrosity    why  not  what  would  you  have  done  if  you  had  found  him  wandering  on  your  native  world  found  him  sleeping  on  a  field  on  earth  red  tentacles  six  legs  pseudopods  and  all      xiv    red  watched  the  ship  leave  his  red  tentacles  which  gave  him  his  nickname  quivered  their  regret  at  lost  opportunity  to  the  very  last  and  the  eyes  at  their  tips  filled  with  drifting  yellowish  crystals  that  were  the  equivalent  of  earthly  tears  youth  by isaac asimov       red and slim found the two strange little animals the morning after     they heard the thunder sounds they knew that they could never show     their new pets to their parents   illustration   there was a spatter of pebbles against the window and the youngster stirred in his sleep another and he was awake  he sat up stiffly in bed seconds passed while he interpreted his strange surroundings he wasnt in his own home of course this was out in the country it was colder than it should be and there was green at the window  slim  the call was a hoarse urgent whisper and the youngster bounded to the open window  slim wasnt his real name but the new friend he had met the day before had needed only one look at his slight figure to say youre slim he added im red  red wasnt his real name either but its appropriateness was obvious they were friends instantly with the quick unquestioning friendship of young ones not yet quite in adolescence before even the first stains of adulthood began to make their appearance  slim cried hi red and waved cheerfully still blinking the sleep out of himself  red kept to his croaking whisper quiet you want to wake somebody  slim noticed all at once that the sun scarcely topped the low hills in the east that the shadows were long and soft and that the grass was wet  slim said more softly whats the matter  red only waved for him to come out  slim dressed quickly gladly confining his morning wash to the momentary sprinkle of a little lukewarm water he let the air dry the exposed portions of his body as he ran out while bare skin grew wet against the dewy grass  red said youve got to be quiet if mom wakes up or dad or your dad or even any of the hands then itll be come on in or youll catch your death of cold  he mimicked voice and tone faithfully so that slim laughed and thought that there had never been so funny a fellow as red  slim said eagerly do you come out here every day like this red real early its like the whole world is just yours isnt it red no one else around and all like that he felt proud at being allowed entrance into this private world  red stared at him sidelong he said carelessly ive been up for hours didnt you hear it last night  hear what  thunder  was there a thunderstorm slim never slept through a thunderstorm  i guess not but there was thunder i heard it and then i went to the window and it wasnt raining it was all stars and the sky was just getting sort of almost gray you know what i mean  slim had never seen it so but he nodded  so i just thought id go out said red  they walked along the grassy side of the concrete road that split the panorama right down the middle all the way down to where it vanished among the hills it was so old that reds father couldnt tell red when it had been built it didnt have a crack or a rough spot in it  red said can you keep a secret  sure red what kind of a secret  just a secret maybe ill tell you and maybe i wont i dont know yet red broke a long supple stem from a fern they passed methodically stripped it of its leaflets and swung what was left whipfashion for a moment he was on a wild charger which reared and champed under his iron control then he got tired tossed the whip aside and stowed the charger away in a corner of his imagination for future use  he said therell be a circus around  slim said thats no secret i knew that my dad told me even before we came here  thats not the secret fine secret ever see a circus  oh sure you bet  like it  say there isnt anything i like better  red was watching out of the corner of his eyes again ever think you would like to be with a circus i mean for good  slim considered i guess not i think ill be an astronomer like my dad i think he wants me to be  huh astronomer said red  slim felt the doors of the new private world closing on him and astronomy became a thing of dead stars and black empty space  he said placatingly a circus would be more fun  youre just saying that  no im not i mean it  red grew argumentative suppose you had a chance to join the circus right now what would you do  ii  see red affected scornful laughter  slim was stung id join up  go on  try me  red whirled at him strange and intense you meant that you want to go in with me  illustration  what do you mean slim stepped back a bit surprised by the unexpected challenge  i got something that can get us into the circus maybe someday we can even have a circus of our own we could be the biggest circusfellows in the world thats if you want to go in with me otherwisewell i guess i can do it on my own i just thought lets give good old slim a chance  the world was strange and glamorous and slim said sure thing red im in what is it huh red tell me what it is  figure it out whats the most important thing in circuses  slim thought desperately he wanted to give the right answer finally he said acrobats  holy smokes i wouldnt go five steps to look at acrobats  i dont know then  animals thats what whats the best sideshow where are the biggest crowds even in the main rings the best acts are animal acts there was no doubt in reds voice  do you think so  everyone thinks so you ask anyone anyway i found animals this morning two of them  and youve got them  sure thats the secret are you telling  of course not  okay ive got them in the barn do you want to see them  they were almost at the barn its huge open door black too black they had been heading there all the time slim stopped in his tracks  he tried to make his words casual are they big  would i fool with them if they were big they cant hurt you theyre only about so long ive got them in a cage  they were in the barn now and slim saw the large cage suspended from a hook in the roof it was covered with stiff canvas  red said we used to have some bird there or something anyway they cant get away from there come on lets go up to the loft  they clambered up the wooden stairs and red hooked the cage toward them  slim pointed and said theres sort of a hole in the canvas  red frowned howd that get there he lifted the canvas looked in and said with relief theyre still there  the canvas appeared to be burned worried slim  you want to look or dont you  slim nodded slowly he wasnt sure he wanted to after all they might be  but the canvas had been jerked off and there they were two of them the way red said they were small and sort of disgustinglooking the animals moved quickly as the canvas lifted and were on the side toward the youngsters red poked a cautious finger at them  watch out said slim in agony  they dont hurt you said red ever see anything like them  no  cant you see how a circus would jump at a chance to have these  maybe theyre too small for a circus  red looked annoyed he let go the cage which swung back and forth pendulumfashion youre just trying to back out arent you  no im not its just  theyre not too small dont worry right now ive only got one worry  whats that  well ive got to keep them till the circus comes dont i ive got to figure out what to feed them meanwhile  the cage swung and the little trapped creatures clung to its bars gesturing at the youngsters with queer quick motionsalmost as though they were intelligent   ii  the astronomer entered the dining room with decorum he felt very much the guest  he said where are the youngsters my son isnt in his room  the industrialist smiled theyve been out for hours however breakfast was forced into them among the women some time ago so there is nothing to worry about youth doctor youth  youth the word seemed to depress the astronomer  they ate breakfast in silence the industrialist said once you really think theyll come the day looks sonormal  the astronomer said theyll come  that was all  afterward the industrialist said youll pardon me i cant conceive your playing so elaborate a hoax you really spoke to them  as i speak to you at least in a sense they can project thoughts  i gathered that must be so from your letter how i wonder  i could not say i asked them and of course they were vague or perhaps it was just that i could not understand it involves a projector for the focussing of thought and even more than that conscious attention on the part of both projector and receptor it was quite a while before i realized they were trying to think at me such thoughtprojectors may be part of the science they will give us  perhaps said the industrialist yet think of the changes it would bring to society a thoughtprojector  why not change would be good for us  i dont think so  it is only in old age that change is unwelcome said the astronomer and races can be old as well as individuals  the industrialist pointed out the window you see that road it was built beforethewars i dont know exactly when it is as good now as the day it was built we couldnt possibly duplicate it now the race was young when that was built eh  then yes at least they werent afraid of new things  no i wish they had been where is the society of beforethewars destroyed doctor what good were youth and new things we are better off now the world is peaceful and jogs along the race goes nowhere but after all there is nowhere to go they proved that the men who built the road i will speak with your visitors as i agreed if they come but i think i will only ask them to go  the race is not going nowhere said the astronomer earnestly it is going toward final destruction my university has a smaller student body each year fewer books are written less work is done an old man sleeps in the sun and his days are peaceful and unchanging but each day finds him nearer death all the same  well well said the industrialist  no dont dismiss it listen before i wrote you i investigated your position in the planetary economy  and you found me solvent interrupted the industrialist smiling  why yes oh i see you are joking and yetperhaps the joke is not far off you are less solvent than your father and he was less solvent than his father perhaps your son will no longer be solvent it becomes too troublesome for the planet to support even the industries that still exist though they are toothpicks to the oak trees of beforethewars we will be back to village economy and then to what the caves  and the infusion of fresh technological knowledge will be the changing of all that  not just the new knowledge rather the whole effect of change of a broadening of horizons look sir i chose you to approach in this matter not only because you were rich and influential with government officials but because you had an unusual reputation for these days of daring to break with tradition our people will resist change and you would know how to handle them how to see to it thatthat  that the youth of the race is revived  yes  with its atomic bombs  the atomic bombs returned the astronomer need not be the end of civilization these visitors of mine had their atomic bomb or whatever their equivalent was on their own worlds and survived it because they didnt give up dont you see it wasnt the bomb that defeated us but our own shell shock this may be the last chance to reverse the process  illustration  tell me said the industrialist what do these friends from space want in return  the astronomer hesitated he said i will be truthful with you they come from a denser planet ours is richer in the lighter atoms  they want magnesium aluminum  no sir carbon and hydrogen they want coal and oil  really  the astronomer said quickly you are going to ask why creatures who have mastered space travel and therefore atomic power would want coal and oil i cant answer that  the industrialist smiled but i can this is the best evidence yet of the truth of your story superficially atomic power would seem to preclude the use of coal and oil however quite apart from the energy gained by their combustion they remain and always will remain the basic raw material for all organic chemistry plastics dyes pharmaceuticals solvents industry could not exist without them even in an atomic age still if coal and oil are the low price for which they would sell us the troubles and tortures of racial youth my answer is that the commodity would be dear if offered gratis  the astronomer sighed and said there are the boys  they were visible through the open window standing together in the grassy field and lost in animated conversation the industrialists son pointed imperiously and the astronomers son nodded and made off at a run toward the house  the industrialist said there is the youth you speak of our race has as much of it as it ever had  yes but we age them quickly and pour them into the mold  slim scuttled into the room the door banging behind him  the astronomer said in mild disapproval whats this  slim looked up in surprise and came to a halt i beg your pardon i didnt know anyone was here i am sorry to have interrupted his enunciation was almost painfully precise  the industrialist said its all right youngster  but the astronomer said even if you had been entering an empty room son there would be no cause for slamming a door  nonsense insisted the industrialist the youngster has done no harm you simply scold him for being young you with your views  he said to slim come here lad  slim advanced slowly  how do you like the country eh  very much sir thank you  my son has been showing you about the place has he  yes sir redi mean  no no call him red i call him that myself now tell me what are you two up to eh  slim looked away whyjust exploring sir  the industrialist turned to the astronomer there you are youthful curiosity and adventurelust the race has not yet lost it  slim said sir  yes lad  the youngster took a long time in getting on with it he said red sent me in for something good to eat but i dont exactly know what he meant i didnt like to say so  why just ask cook shell have something good for younguns to eat  oh no sir i mean for animals  for animals  yes sir what do animals eat  the astronomer said i am afraid my son is citybred  well said the industrialist theres no harm in that what kind of an animal lad  a small one sir  then try grass or leaves and if they dont want that nuts or berries would probably do the trick  thank you sir slim ran out again closing the door gently behind him  the astronomer said do you suppose theyve trapped an animal alive he was obviously perturbed  thats common enough theres no shooting on my estate and its tame country full of rodents and small creatures red is always coming home with pets of one sort or another they rarely maintain his interest for long  he looked at the wall clock your friends should have been here by now shouldnt they   iii  the swaying had come to a halt and it was dark the explorer was not comfortable in the alien air it felt as thick as soup and he had to breathe shallowly even so  he reached out in a sudden need for company the merchant was warm to the touch his breathing was rough he moved in an occasional spasm and was obviously asleep the explorer hesitated and decided not to wake him it would serve no real purpose  there would be no rescue of course that was the penalty paid for the high profits which unrestrained competition could lead to the merchant who opened a new planet could have a ten year monopoly of its trade which he might hug to himself or more likely rent out to all comers at a stiff price it followed that planets were searched for in secrecy and preferably away from the usual trade routes in a case such as theirs then there was little or no chance that another ship would come within range of their subetherics except for the most improbable of coincidences even if they were in their ship that is rather than in thisthiscage  the explorer grasped the thick bars even if they blasted those away as they could they would be stuck too high in open air for leaping  it was too bad they had landed twice before in the scoutship they had established contact with the natives who were grotesquely huge but mild and unaggressive it was obvious that they had once owned a flourishing technology but hadnt faced up to the consequences of such a technology it would have been a wonderful market  and it was a tremendous world the merchant especially had been taken aback he had known the figures that expressed the planets diameter but from a distance of two lightseconds he had stood at the visiplate and muttered unbelievable  oh there are larger worlds the explorer said it wouldnt do for an explorer to be too easily impressed  inhabited  well no  why you could drop your planet into that large ocean and drown it  the explorer smiled it was a gentle dig at his arcturian homeland which was smaller than most planets he said not quite  the merchant followed along the line of his thoughts and the inhabitants are large in proportion to their world he sounded as though the news struck him less favorably now  nearly ten times our height  are you sure they are friendly  that is hard to say friendship between alien intelligences is an imponderable they are not dangerous i think weve come across other groups that could not maintain equilibrium after the atomic war stage and you know the results introversion retreat gradual decadence and increasing gentleness  even if they are such monsters  the principle remains  it was about then that the explorer felt the heavy throbbing of the engines  he frowned and said we are descending a bit too quickly  there had been some speculation on the dangers of landing some hours before the planetary target was a huge one for an oxygenwater world though it lacked the size of the uninhabitable hydrogenammonia planets and its low density made its surface gravity fairly normal its gravitational forces fell off but slowly with distance in short its gravitational potential was high and the ships calculator was a runofthemill model not designed to plot landing trajectories at that potential range that meant the pilot would have to use manual controls  it would have been wiser to install a more highpowered model but that would have meant a trip to some outpost of civilization lost time perhaps a lost secret the merchant demanded an immediate landing  the merchant felt it necessary to defend his position now he said angrily to the explorer dont you think the pilot knows his job he landed you safely twice before  yes thought the explorer in a scoutship not in this unmaneuverable freighter aloud he said nothing  he kept his eye on the visiplate they were descending too quickly there was no room for doubt much too quickly  the merchant said peevishly why do you keep silence  well then if you wish me to speak i would suggest that you strap on your floater and help me prepare the ejector  the pilot fought a noble fight he was no beginner the atmosphere abnormally high and thick in the gravitational potential of this world whipped and burned about the ship but to the very last it looked as though he might bring it under control despite that  he even maintained course following the extrapolated line to the point on the northern continent toward which they were headed under other circumstances with a shade more luck the story would eventually have been told and retold as a heroic and masterly reversal of a lost situation but within sight of victory tired body and tired nerves clamped a control bar with a shade too much pressure the ship which had almost levelled off dipped down again  there was no room to retrieve the final error there was only a mile left to fall the pilot remained at his post to the actual landing his only thought that of breaking the force of the crash of maintaining the spaceworthiness of the vessel he did not survive with the ship bucking madly in a soupy atmosphere few ejectors could be mobilized and only one of them in time  when afterwards the explorer lifted out of unconsciousness and rose to his feet he had the definite feeling that but for himself and the merchant there were no survivors and perhaps that was an overcalculation his floater had burnt out while still sufficiently distant from surface to have the fall stun him the merchant might have had less luck even than that  he was surrounded by a world of thick ropy stalks of grass and in the distance were trees that reminded him vaguely of similar structures on his native arcturian world except that their lowest branches were high above what he would consider normal treetops  he called his voice sounding basso in the thick air and the merchant answered the explorer made his way toward him thrusting violently at the coarse stalks that barred his path  are you hurt he asked  the merchant grimaced ive sprained something it hurts to walk  the explorer probed gently i dont think anything is broken youll have to walk despite the pain  cant we rest first  its important to try to find the ship if it is spaceworthy or if it can be repaired we may live otherwise we wont  just a few minutes let me catch my breath  the explorer was glad enough for those few minutes the merchants eyes were already closed he allowed his to do the same  he heard the trampling and his eyes snapped open never sleep on a strange planet he told himself futilely  the merchant was awake too and his steady screaming was a rumble of terror  the explorer called its only a native of this planet it wont harm you  but even as he spoke the giant had swooped down and in a moment they were in its grasp being lifted closer to its monstrous ugliness  the merchant struggled violently and of course quite futilely cant you talk to it he yelled  the explorer could only shake his head i cant reach it with the projector it wont be listening  then blast it blast it down  we cant do that the phrase you fool had almost been added the explorer struggled to keep his selfcontrol they were swallowing space as the monster moved purposefully away  why not cried the merchant you can reach your blaster i see it in plain sight dont be afraid of falling  its simpler than that if this monster is killed youll never trade with this planet youll never even leave it you probably wont live the day out  why why  because this is one of the young of the species you should know what happens when a trader kills a native young even accidentally whats more if this is the targetpoint then we are on the estate of a powerful native this might be one of his brood  that was how they entered their present prison they had carefully burnt away a portion of the thick stiff covering and it was obvious that the height from which they were suspended was a killing one  now once again the prisoncage shuddered and lifted in an upward arc the merchant rolled to the lower rim and startled awake the cover lifted and light flooded in as was the case the time before there were two specimens of the young they were not very different in appearance from adults of the species reflected the explorer though of course they were considerably smaller  a handful of reedy green stalks was stuffed between the bars its odor was not unpleasant but it carried clods of soil at its ends  the merchant drew away and said huskily what are they doing  the explorer said trying to feed us i should judge at least this seems to be the native equivalent of grass  the cover was replaced and they were set swinging again alone with their fodder   iv  slim started at the sound of footsteps and brightened when it turned out to be only red  he said no ones around i had my eye peeled you bet  red said ssh look you take this stuff and stick it in the cage ive got to scoot back to the house  what is it slim reached reluctantly  ground meat holy smokes havent you ever seen ground meat thats what you shouldve got when i sent you to the house instead of coming back with that stupid grass  slim was hurt howd i know they dont eat grass besides ground meat doesnt come loose like that it comes in cellophane and it isnt that color  surein the city out here we grind our own and its always this color till its cooked  you mean it isnt cooked slim drew away quickly  red looked disgusted do you think animals eat cooked food come on take it it wont hurt you i tell you there isnt much time  why whats doing back at the house  i dont know dad and your father are walking around i think maybe theyre looking for me maybe the cook told them i took the meat anyway we dont want them coming here after me  didnt you ask the cook before you took this stuff  who that crab shouldnt wonder if she only let me have a drink of water because dad makes her come on take it  slim took the large glob of meat though his skin crawled at the touch he turned toward the barn and red sped away in the direction from which he had come  he slowed when he approached the two adults took a few deep breaths to bring himself back to normal and then carefully and nonchalantly sauntered past they were walking in the general direction of the barn he noticed but not dead on  he said hi dad hello sir  the industrialist said just a moment red i have a question to ask you  red turned a carefully blank face to his father yes dad  mother tells me you were out early this morning  not real early dad just a little before breakfast  she said you told her it was because you had been awakened during the night and didnt go back to sleep  red waited before answering should he have told mom that  then he said yes sir  what was it that awakened you  red saw no harm in it he said i dont know dad it sounded like thunder sort of and like a collision sort of  could you tell where it came from  it sounded like it was out by the hill that was truthful and useful as well since the direction was almost opposite that in which the barn lay  the industrialist looked at his guest i suppose it would do no harm to walk toward the hill  the astronomer said i am ready  red watched them walk away and when he turned he saw slim peering cautiously out from among the briars of a hedge  red waved at him come on  slim stepped out and approached did they say anything about the meat  no i guess they dont know about that they went down to the hill  what for  search me they kept asking about the noise i heard listen did the animals eat the meat  well said slim cautiously they were sort of looking at it and smelling it or something  okay red said i guess theyll eat it holy smokes theyve got to eat something lets walk along toward the hill and see what dad and your father are going to do  what about the animals  theyll be all right a fellow cant spend all his time on them did you give them water  sure they drank that  see come on well look at them after lunch i tell you what well bring them fruit anythingll eat fruit  together they trotted up the rise red as usual in the lead   v  the astronomer said you think the noise was their ship landing  dont you think it could be  if it were they may all be dead  perhaps not the industrialist frowned  if they have landed and are still alive where are they  think about that for a while he was still frowning  the astronomer said i dont understand you  they may not be friendly  oh no ive spoken with them theyve  youve spoken with them call that reconnaissance what would their next step be invasion  but they only have one ship sir  you know that only because they say so they might have a fleet  ive told you about their size they  their size would not matter if they have handweapons that may well be superior to our artillery  that is not what i meant  i had this partly in mind from the first the industrialist went on it is for that reason i agreed to see them after i received your letter not to agree to an unsettling and impossible trade but to judge their real purposes i did not count on their evading the meeting  he sighed i suppose it isnt our fault you are right in one thing at any rate the world has been at peace too long we are losing a healthy sense of suspicion  the astronomers mild voice rose to an unusual pitch and he said i will speak i tell you that there is no reason to suppose they can possibly be hostile they are small yes but that is only important because it is a reflection of the fact that their native worlds are small our world has what is for them a normal gravity but because of our much higher gravitational potential our atmosphere is too dense to support them comfortably over sustained periods for a similar reason the use of the world as a base for interstellar travel except for trade in certain items is uneconomical and there are important differences in chemistry of life due to the basic differences in soils they couldnt eat our food or we theirs  surely all this can be overcome they can bring their own food build domed stations of lowered air pressure devise specially designed ships  they can and how glibly you can describe feats that are easy to a race in its youth it is simply that they dont have to do any of that there are millions of worlds suitable for them in the galaxy they dont need this one which isnt  how do you know all this is their information again  this i was able to check independently i am an astronomer after all  that is true let me hear what you have to say then while we walk  then sir consider that for a long time our astronomers have believed that two general classes of planetary bodies existed first the planets which formed at distances far enough from their stellar nucleus to become cool enough to capture hydrogen these would be large planets rich in hydrogen ammonia and methane we have examples of these in the giant outer planets the second class would include those planets formed so near the stellar center that the high temperature would make it impossible to capture much hydrogen these would be smaller planets comparatively poorer in hydrogen and richer in oxygen we know that type very well since we live on one ours is the only solar system we know in detail however and it has been reasonable for us to assume that these were the only two planetary classes  i take it then that there is another  yes there is a superdense class still smaller poorer in hydrogen than the inner planets of the solar system the ratio of occurrence of hydrogenammonia planets and these superdense wateroxygen worlds of theirs over the entire galaxyand remember that they have actually conducted a survey of significant sample volumes of the galaxy which we without interstellar travel cannot dois about 3 to 1 this leaves them seven million superdense worlds for exploration and colonization  the industrialist looked at the blue sky and the greencovered trees among which they were making their way he said and worlds like ours  the astronomer said softly ours is the first solar system they have found which contains them apparently the development of our solar system was unique and did not follow the ordinary rules  the industrialist considered that what it amounts to is that these creatures from space are asteroiddwellers  no no the asteroids are something else again they occur i was told in one out of eight stellar systems but theyre completely different from what weve been discussing  and how does your being an astronomer change the fact that you are still only quoting their unsupported statements  but they did not restrict themselves to bald items of information they presented me with a theory of stellar evolution which i had to accept and which is more nearly valid than anything our own astronomy has ever been able to devise if we except possible lost theories dating from beforethewars mind you their theory had a rigidly mathematical development and it predicted just such a galaxy as they describe so you see they have all the worlds they wish they are not landhungry certainly not for our land  reason would say so if what you say is true but creatures may be intelligent and not reasonable our forefathers were presumably intelligent yet they were certainly not reasonable was it reasonable to destroy almost all their tremendous civilization in atomic warfare over causes our historians can no longer accurately determine the industrialist brooded over it from the dropping of the first atom bomb over those islandsi forget the ancient namethere was only one end in sight and in plain sight yet events were allowed to proceed to that end  he looked up said briskly well where are we i wonder if we are not on a fools errand after all  but the astronomer was a little in advance and his voice came thickly no fools errand sir look there   vi  red and slim had trailed their elders with the experience of youth aided by the absorption and anxiety of their fathers their view of the final object of the search was somewhat obscured by the underbrush behind which they remained  red said holy smokes look at that its all shiny silver or something  but it was slim who was really excited he caught at the other i know what this is its a spaceship that must be why my father came here hes one of the biggest astronomers in the world and your father would have to call him if a spaceship landed on his estate  what are you talking about dad didnt even know that thing was there he only came here because i told him i heard the thunder from here besides there isnt any such thing as a spaceship  sure there is look at it see those round things they are ports and you can see the rocket tubes  how do you know so much  slim was flushed he said i read about them my father has books about them old books from beforethewars  huh now i know youre making it up books from beforethewars  my father has to have them he teaches at the university its his job  his voice had risen and red had to pull at him you want them to hear us he whispered indignantly  well it is too a spaceship  look here slim you mean thats a ship from another world  its got to be look at my father going round and round it he wouldnt be so interested if it was anything else  other worlds where are there other worlds  everywhere how about the planets theyre worlds just like ours some of them and other stars probably have planets theres probably zillions of planets  red felt outweighed and outnumbered he muttered youre crazy  all right then ill show you  hey where are you going  down there im going to ask my father i suppose youll believe it if he tells you i suppose youll believe a professor of astronomy knows what  he had scrambled upright  red said hey you dont want them to see us were not supposed to be here do you want them to start asking questions and find out about our animals  i dont care you said i was crazy  snitcher you promised you wouldnt tell  im not going to tell but if they find out themselves its your fault for starting an argument and saying i was crazy  i take it back then grumbled red  well all right you better  in a way slim was disappointed he wanted to see the spaceship at closer quarters still he could not break his vow of secrecy even in spirit without at least the excuse of personal insult  red said its awfully small for a spaceship  sure because its probably a scoutship  ill bet dad couldnt even get into the old thing  so much slim realized to be true it was a weak point in his argument and he made no answer his interest was absorbed by the adults  red rose to his feet an elaborate attitude of boredom all about him well i guess we better be going theres business to do and i cant spend all day here looking at some old spaceship or whatever it is weve got to take care of the animals if were going to be circusfolks thats the first rule with circusfolks theyve got to take care of the animals and he finished virtuously thats what i aim to do anyway  slim said what for red theyve got plenty of meat lets watch  theres no fun in watching besides dad and your father are going away and i guess its about lunch time  red became argumentative look slim we cant start acting suspicious or theyre going to start investigating holy smokes dont you ever read any detective stories when youre trying to work a big deal without being caught its practically the main thing to keep on acting just like always then they dont suspect anything thats the first law  oh all right  slim rose resentfully at the moment the circus appeared to him a rather tawdry and shoddy substitute for the glories of astronomy and he wondered how he had come to fall in with reds silly scheme  down the slope they went slim as usual in the rear   vii  the industrialist said its the workmanship that gets me i never saw such construction  what good is it now said the astronomer bitterly theres nothing left therell be no second landing this ship detected life on our planet through accident other exploring parties would come no closer than necessary to establish the fact that there were no superdense worlds existing in our solar system  well theres no quarreling with a crash landing  the ship hardly seems damaged if only some had survived the ship might have been repaired  if they had survived there would be no trade in any case theyre too different too disturbing in any caseits over  they entered the house and the industrialist greeted his wife calmly lunch about ready dear  im afraid not you see she looked hesitantly at the astronomer  is anything wrong asked the industrialist why not tell me im sure our guest wont mind a little family discussion  pray dont pay any attention whatever to me muttered the astronomer he moved miserably to the other end of the living room  the woman said in low hurried tones really dear cooks that upset ive been soothing her for hours and honestly i dont know why red should have done it  done what the industrialist was more amused than otherwise it had taken the united efforts of himself and his son months to argue his wife into using the name red rather than the perfectly ridiculous viewed youngster fashion name which was his real one  she said hes taken most of the chopped meat  hes eaten it  well i hope not it was raw  then what would he want it for  i havent the slightest idea i havent seen him since breakfast meanwhile cooks just furious she caught him vanishing out the kitchen door and there was the bowl of chopped meat just about empty and she was going to use it for lunch well you know cook she had to change the lunch menu and that means she wont be worth living with for a week youll just have to speak to red dear and make him promise not to do things in the kitchen any more and it wouldnt hurt to have him apologize to cook  oh come she works for us if we dont complain about a change in lunch menu why should she  because shes the one who has doublework made for her and shes talking about quitting good cooks arent easy to get do you remember the one before her  it was a strong argument  the industrialist looked about vaguely he said i suppose youre right he isnt here i suppose when he comes in ill talk to him  youd better start here he comes  red walked into the house and said cheerfully time for lunch i guess he looked from one parent to the other in quick speculation at their fixed stares and said got to clean up first though and made for the other door  the industrialist said one moment son  sir  wheres your little friend  red said carelessly hes around somewhere we were just sort of walking and i looked around and he wasnt there this was perfectly true and red felt on safe ground i told him it was lunch time i said i suppose its about lunch time i said we got to be getting back to the house and he said yes and i just went on and then when i was about at the creek i looked around and  the astronomer interrupted the voluble story looking up from a magazine he had been sightlessly rummaging through i wouldnt worry about my youngster he is quite selfreliant dont wait lunch for him  lunch isnt ready in any case doctor the industrialist turned once more to his son and talking about that son the reason for it is that something happened to the ingredients do you have anything to say  sir  i hate to feel that i have to explain myself more fully why did you take the chopped meat  the chopped meat  the chopped meat he waited patiently  red said well i was sort of  hungry prompted his father for raw meat  no sir i just sort of needed it  for what exactly  red looked miserable and remained silent  the astronomer broke in again if you dont mind my putting in a few wordsyoull remember that just after breakfast my son came in to ask what animals ate  oh youre right how stupid of me to forget look here red did you take it for an animal pet youve got  red recovered indignant breath he said you mean slim came in here and said i had an animal he came in here and said that he said i had an animal  no he didnt he simply asked what animals ate thats all now if he promised he wouldnt tell on you he didnt its your own foolishness in trying to take something without permission that gave you away that happened to be stealing now have you an animal i ask you a direct question  yes sir it was a whisper so low as hardly to be heard  all right youll have to get rid of it do you understand  reds mother intervened do you mean to say youre keeping a meateating animal red it might bite you and give you bloodpoison  theyre only small ones quavered red they hardly budge if you touch them  they how many do you have  two  where are they  the industrialist touched her arm dont chivvy the child any further he said in a low voice if he says hell get rid of them he will and thats punishment enough  he dismissed the matter from his mind   viii  lunch was half over when slim dashed into the dining room for a moment he stood abashed and then he said in what was almost hysteria ive got to speak to red ive got to say something  red looked up in fright but the astronomer said i dont think son youre being very polite youve kept lunch waiting  im sorry father  oh dont rate the lad said the industrialists wife he can speak to red if he wants to and there was no damage done to the lunch  ive got to speak to red alone slim insisted  now thats enough said the astronomer with a kind of gentleness that was obviously manufactured for the benefit of strangers and which had beneath it an easilyrecognized edge take your seat  slim did so but he ate only when someone looked directly upon him even then he was not very successful  red caught his eyes he made soundless words did the animals get loose  slim shook his head slightly he whispered no its  the astronomer looked at him hard and slim faltered to a stop  with lunch over red slipped out of the room with a microscopic motion at slim to follow  they walked in silence to the creek  then red turned fiercely upon his companion look here whats the idea of telling my dad we were feeding animals  slim said i didnt i asked what you feed animals thats not the same as saying we were doing it besides its something else red  but red had not used up his grievances and where did you go anyway i thought you were coming to the house they acted like it was my fault you werent there  but im trying to tell you about that if youd only shut up a second and let me talk you dont give a fellow a chance  well go on and tell me if youve got so much to say  im trying to i went back to the spaceship the folks werent there anymore and i wanted to see what it was like  it isnt a spaceship said red sullenly he had nothing to lose  it is too i looked inside you could look through the ports and i looked inside and they were dead he looked sick they were dead  who were dead  slim screeched animals like our animals only they arent animals theyre peoplethings from other planets  for a moment red might have been turned to stone it didnt occur to him to disbelieve slim at this point slim looked too genuinely the bearer of just such tidings he said finally oh my  well what are we going to do golly will we get a whopping if they find out he was shivering  we better turn them loose said red  theyll tell on us  they cant talk our language not if theyre from another planet  yes they can because i remember my father talking about some stuff like that to my mother when he didnt know i was in the room he was talking about visitors who could talk with the mind telepathery or something i thought he was making it up  well holy smokes i meanholy smokes red looked up i tell you my dad said to get rid of them lets sort of bury them somewhere or throw them in the creek  he told you to do that  he made me say i had animals and then he said get rid of them i got to do what he says holy smokes hes my dad  some of the panic left slims heart it was a thoroughly legalistic way out well lets do it right now then before they find out oh golly if they find out will we be in trouble  they broke into a run toward the barn unspeakable visions in their minds   ix  it was different looking at them as though they were people as animals they had been interesting as people horrible their eyes which were neutral little objects before now seemed to watch them with active malevolence  theyre making noises said slim in a whisper which was barely audible  i guess theyre talking or something said red funny that those noises which they had heard before had not had significance earlier he was making no move toward them neither was slim  the canvas was off but they were just watching the ground meat slim noticed hadnt been touched  slim said arent you going to do something  arent you  you found them  its your turn now  no it isnt you found them its your fault the whole thing i was watching  you joined in slim you know you did  i dont care you found them and thats what ill say when they come here looking for us  red said all right for you but the thought of the consequences inspired him anyway and he reached for the cage door  slim said wait  red was glad to he said now whats biting you  one of thems got something on him that looks like it might be iron or something  where  right there i saw it before but i thought it was just part of him but if hes people maybe its a disintegrator gun  whats that  i read about it in the books from beforethewars mostly people with spaceships have disintegrator guns they point them at you and you get disintegratored  they didnt point it at us till now pointed out red with his heart not quite in it  i dont care im not hanging around here and getting disintegratored im getting my father  cowardycat yellow cowardycat  i dont care you can call all the names you want but if you bother them now youll get disintegratored you wait and see and itll be all your fault  he made for the narrow spiral stairs that led to the main floor of the barn stopped at its head then backed away  reds mother was moving up panting a little with the exertion and smiling a tight smile for the benefit of slim in his capacity as guest  red you red are you up there now dont try to hide i know this is where youre keeping them cook saw where you ran with the meat  red quavered hello ma  now show me those nasty animals im going to see to it that you get rid of them right away  it was over and despite the imminent corporal punishment red felt something like a load fall from him at least the decision was out of his hands  right there ma i didnt do anything to them ma i didnt know they just looked like little animals and i thought youd let me keep them ma i wouldnt have taken the meat only they wouldnt eat grass or leaves and we couldnt find good nuts or berries and cook never lets me have anything or i would have asked her and i didnt know it was for lunch and  he was speaking on the sheer momentum of terror and did not realize that his mother did not hear him but with eyes frozen and popping at the cage was screaming in thin piercing tones   x  the astronomer was saying a quiet burial is all we can do there is no point in any publicity now when they heard the screams  she had not entirely recovered by the time she reached them running and running it was minutes before her husband could extract sense from her  she was saying finally i tell you theyre in the barn i dont know what they are no no  she barred the industrialists quick movement in that direction she said dont you go send one of the hands with a shotgun i tell you i never saw anything like it little horrible beasts withwithi cant describe it to think that red was touching them and trying to feed them he was holding them and feeding them meat  red began i only  and slim said it was not  the industrialist said quickly now you boys have done enough harm today march into the house and not a word not one word im not interested in anything you have to say after this is all over ill hear you out and as for you red ill see that youre properly punished  he turned to his wife now whatever the animals are well have them killed he added quietly once the youngsters were out of hearing come come the children arent hurt and after all they havent done anything really terrible theyve just found a new pet  the astronomer spoke with difficulty pardon me maam but can you describe these animals  she shook her head she was quite beyond words  can you just tell me if they  im sorry said the industrialist apologetically but i think i had better take care of her will you excuse me  a moment please one moment she said she had never seen such animals before surely it is not usual to find animals that are completely unique on an estate such as this  im sorry lets not discuss that now  except that unique animals might have landed during the night  the industrialist stepped away from his wife what are you implying  i think we had better go to the barn sir  the industrialist stared a moment turned and suddenly and quite uncharacteristically began running the astronomer followed and the womans wail rose unheeded behind them   xi  the industrialist stared looked at the astronomer turned to stare again  those  those said the astronomer i have no doubt we appear strange and repulsive to them  what do they say  why that they are uncomfortable and tired and even a little sick but that they are not seriously damaged and that the youngsters treated them well  treated them well scooping them up keeping them in a cage giving them grass and raw meat to eat tell me how to speak to them  it may take a little time think at them try to listen it will come to you but perhaps not right away  the industrialist tried he grimaced with the effort of it thinking over and over again the youngsters were ignorant of your identity  and the thought was suddenly in his mind we were quite aware of it and because we knew they meant well by us according to their own view of the matter we did not attempt to attack them  attack them thought the industrialist and said it aloud in his concentration  why yes came the answering thought we are armed  one of the revolting little creatures in the cage lifted a metal object and there was a sudden hole in the top of the cage and another in the roof of the barn each hole rimmed with charred wood  we hope the creatures thought it will not be too difficult to make repairs  the industrialist found it impossible to organize himself to the point of directed thought he turned to the astronomer and with that weapon in their possession they let themselves be handled and caged i dont understand it  but the calm thought came we would not harm the young of an intelligent species   xii  it was twilight the industrialist had entirely missed the evening meal and remained unaware of the fact  he said do you really think the ship will fly  if they say so said the astronomer im sure it will theyll be back i hope before too long  and when they do said the industrialist energetically i will keep my part of the agreement what is more i will move sky and earth to have the world accept them i was entirely wrong doctor creatures that would refuse to harm children under such provocation as they received are admirable but you knowi almost hate to say this  say what  the kids yours and mine im almost proud of them imagine seizing these creatures feeding them or trying to and keeping them hidden the amazing gall of it red told me it was his idea to get a job in a circus on the strength of them imagine  the astronomer said youth   xiii  the merchant said will we be taking off soon  half an hour said the explorer  it was going to be a lonely trip back all the remaining seventeen of the crew were dead and their ashes were to be left on a strange planet back they would go with a limping ship and the burden of the controls entirely on himself  the merchant said it was a good business stroke not harming the young ones we will get very good terms very good terms  the explorer thought business  the merchant then said theyve lined up to see us off all of them you dont think theyre too close do you it would be bad to burn any of them with the rocket blast at this stage of the game  theyre safe  horriblelooking things arent they  pleasant enough inside their thoughts are perfectly friendly  you wouldnt believe it of them that immature one the one that first picked us up  they call him red provided the explorer  thats a queer name for a monster makes me laugh he actually feels bad that were leaving only i cant make out exactly why the nearest i can come to it is something about a lost opportunity with some organization or other that i cant quite interpret  a circus said the explorer briefly  what why the impertinent monstrosity  why not what would you have done if you had found him wandering on your native world found him sleeping on a field on earth red tentacles six legs pseudopods and all   xiv  red watched the ship leave his red tentacles which gave him his nickname quivered their regret at lost opportunity to the very last and the eyes at their tips filled with drifting yellowish crystals that were the equivalent of earthly tears '"
