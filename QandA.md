## What do you mean by multiple visualizations?

You should show your data in a variety of different ways. For instance, using Pokemon data as an example, you might:

* Create a pie chart showing the percentage of pokemon represented by each type
* Create a heatmap showing the frequency with which two types are represented within a particular pokemon
* Create a scatter graph showing the relationship between size and weight of pokemon
* Create histograms showing the distribution of sizes, grouped by origin
* Show trends in pokemon weight over time
